The institute is also dedicated to protecting the environment and nature and taking every possible initiative to contribute to the greenification of the campus. In line with this, ‘Anunaad’, the Sound Garden, was inaugurated at the campus on June 21, 2022, by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. The garden was inaugurated, rejoicing the International Yoga Day 2022, which aims at encouraging physical, mental, and spiritual wellness of all. Similarly, music also plays a significant role in our lives, uplifting our mood and adding joy. Thus, inaugurated on World Music Day, Anunaad expresses a new paradigm and holistic approach toward health and wellness. Inaugurating the garden, Prof. Rai said that sound and music help keep our minds at peace and relieve stress. He noted that our spiritual journey is dependent on three factors – courage, the ability to self-reflect, and being content. ‘You need the courage to overpower your anger, for the courageous people can be humble too. Only the ones who are fearful take out their anger on others. Be kind to yourself and everyone around you, he said. Identify your purpose and find out ways to improve yourself. This will help us strengthen our institute as a whole, for individual contribution would add to the progress. He advised the community to be content. ‘Many times, we believe that we own certain things – our knowledge, job, designation, etc. However, we must remember that what we own today belonged to someone else yesterday and would be inherited by someone else tomorrow. Thus, work hard, stay devoted, and committed, but remember to focus only on your duties rather than results’, he concluded. Spread over 12,000 square feet, the garden is a blend of many colorful flowering plants and natural sound waves. The windchimes for generating musical sound waves have been sourced from SVARAM Institute of Musical Instruments and Research Center Auroville, Tamil Nadu. These distinct wind chimes produce a powerful energy flow in the environment with their natural sounds, enchanting the environment with cheerful, positive, and happy vibes. This mesmerizing amalgamation of nature and sound is bound to rejuvenate our minds, help us de-stress, and find solace in the beautiful garden. There are about 5000 plants here including different types of roses, night queen and jasmine flowers. This garden is ideal for meditating, reflecting, introspecting, or merely enjoying the beauty of nature. IIM Indore has been enthusiastic about revamping the empty spaces and transforming those into beautiful, green lands that add to the greenery of the campus. In the last three years, the institute has witnessed the establishment of the Spiritual Garden, the Zen Garden, the Organic Garden, and Sanjeevani – the Horticulture Cell. The institute looks forward to many more green initiatives on campus. Previous Next"

This year’s theme, “Bridging Purpose and Performance – Business Education as a Force for Good,” set the tone for four days of reflection, exchange, and collaboration among some of the world’s most influential business schools. The convention was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Mr. Martial Guiette, Founder & CEO of Eduniversal, and Dr. Aneeta Madhok, Eduniversal Scientific Committee Member for Central Asia, and Shri Pushyamitra Bhargava, Mayor of Indore, were also present on this occasion. In his inaugural address, Prof. Himanshu Rai urged business schools to balance excellence and ethics. “Education must go beyond success,” he said. “Our mission is to shape leaders who act with courage, compassion, and clarity of purpose.” His words echoed throughout the opening keynote, “Ethical Leadership: Lessons from the Vedas,” which drew on India’s ancient wisdom to remind participants that knowledge without integrity has no enduring power. Mr. Martial Guiette, Founder and CEO of Eduniversal, emphasized the need for business schools to align their values with concrete outcomes: “Today’s leaders are not judged only by what they achieve, but by how their achievements serve others. Business education must inspire not just intelligence, but integrity, a balance between purpose and performance that defines true excellence.” Dr. Aneeta Madhok offered a concise introduction to the Eduniversal World Convention. She said that this year’s theme, “Business Education as a Force For Good,” means that we need to educate our students to go beyond leading businesses for profit. The need of the hour is to cultivate leaders who understand purpose, responsibility, sustainability, and innovation. She warmly welcomed delegates from around the world, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the shared commitment to shaping the future of management education. Shri Pushyamitra Bhargava highlighted Indore’s remarkable journey to becoming India’s cleanest city, achieved through citizen participation, strong governance, and an unwavering commitment to sustainable development. ‘Indore has emerged as a vibrant center of innovation, culture, and economic growth, making it an ideal host for global academic gatherings’, he said. He praised IIM Indore for elevating the city’s intellectual stature, earning global recognition, and contributing significantly to education, research, and community development. The first day witnessed two panel discussions and a keynote address. The first panel, “Crafting Social Impact in Business Education,” brought together leading academics and deans to discuss how institutions can translate noble intentions into measurable results. Participants explored ways to embed sustainability, inclusion, and ethical reasoning in both curriculum and culture. The consensus was clear: the future of management education depends not only on what schools teach, but on what they stand for. The second panel, “Experiential Learning Models,” showcased how schools are reimagining teaching for an age of disruption. Speakers presented programs that move students out of classrooms and into the world – from startups and social enterprises to remote Himalayan communities. The keynote address, “Educating Leaders with Conscience: The New Imperative for Business Schools,” delivered by Dr. Virginijus Kundrotas, Eduniversal Scientific Committee Member for Central & Eastern Europe, was also enriching. The address reinforced the day’s overarching theme: developing principled leaders guided by empathy and moral integrity. It emphasized that the true mission of business schools extends beyond producing competent professionals – it lies in shaping individuals who lead with compassion, responsibility, and purpose. Other sessions of the day included: Rural Engagement and Himalayan Outbound Programmes – immersive projects building leadership through community work; The Art of Mithila – an innovative use of Indian art and symbolism to nurture creative thinking; Yoga for Mindful Living – integrating well-being and self-awareness into business education. Participants joined a symbolic tree-planting ceremony titled “Planting for the Future.” The initiative reflected IIM Indore’s deep commitment to sustainability and its belief that learning is most powerful when it connects people, place, and purpose. Delegates also enjoyed a guided campus tour, discovering how the institute’s hillside architecture and natural landscape embody its ethos of openness and growth. The evening concluded with a networking dinner, where conversations flowed easily among deans from every continent, united by a shared belief that business education can – and must – be a force for good.

Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, expressed delight at the successful conclusion of the conference. Reflecting on the past three days, he said that the discussions had been rich, diverse, and deeply engaging, covering everything from current discourses in Chinese Studies to global trade, technology, and sustainability. Prof. Rai noted that understanding China is central to India’s strategic and developmental thinking and that such conferences play a crucial role in deepening that understanding through rigorous research and dialogue. “True learning lies in questioning, revisiting, and refining one’s understanding – and moving ahead on a journey in pursuit of truth”, he said. He emphasized that this year’s AICCS embodied that same spirit of inquiry, collaboration, and openness that academia must continue to nurture. Prof. Rai also commended the convenors, faculty, volunteers, and participants for making the 18th AICCS a success. The Valedictory Address was delivered by Mr. Seshadri Chari, Member, Governing Council, Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS).

The three-day conference brings together scholars, diplomats, business leaders, and policy experts to deliberate on the evolving dynamics of globalization and China’s growing influence in trade, technology, and sustainability. The conference was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Chief Guest Ambassador Ashok K. Kantha, Former Ambassador of India to China and Distinguished Fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation, New Delhi; Ms. Alka Acharya, Director, Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi; Prof. G. Venkat Raman, Convenor of the 18th AICCS and Faculty, IIM Indore; and Mr. Aravind Yelery, Co-Convenor of the conference and Faculty, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), along with other distinguished participants, were also present on this occasion. Delivering the inaugural address, Prof. Rai highlighted that in today’s interconnected world, India and China are two of the fastest-growing large economies, and they stand at the center of global conversations on trade, technology, and sustainability. “Both countries draw on a history of innovation—India with its contributions in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine, and China, with its advancements in the compass, papermaking, and engineering. Today, this shared emphasis on knowledge and research allows both nations to compete and collaborate in emerging technologies, renewable energy, and global infrastructure development,” he said. “Our capacity to harness human capital, scale solutions, and innovate across disciplines is a shared strength that can benefit not only our nations but the world,” he added. He further emphasized the deep governance traditions and cultural richness that both civilizations share. “India and China possess remarkable governance traditions, with long histories of organized bureaucracy, civil services, and educational systems that promote social mobility and meritocracy. Combined with our shared commitment to education, research, and global engagement, these strengths provide a solid foundation for contributing meaningfully to global stability and sustainable growth.” During his keynote address, Amb. Kantha discussed China’s rise, innovation-driven growth, and geopolitical ambitions, stressing that India must engage pragmatically while strengthening strategic autonomy. He reflected on the downturn in India-China relations since 2020, emphasized border stability, cautious economic and people-centric engagement, and warned against overreliance on Western perspectives, urging homegrown frameworks to navigate challenges and opportunities effectively. Ms. Alka Acharya underlined the need to deepen India’s understanding of China. She highlighted AICCS as a unique platform fostering interdisciplinary dialogue, mentorship for emerging scholars, and collaboration between research and policy. “With institutional support and resources, the goal is to expand China studies, build expertise, and encourage rigorous scholarship and informed engagement,” she said. Prof. G. Venkat Raman emphasized China’s rapid rise and its impact on globalization, trade, technology, and sustainability. Emphasizing the need to understand China’s scale, speed, and ambitions, he noted the conference’s role in fostering dialogue, collaboration, and engagement between scholars, policymakers, and industry leaders. Mr. Aravind Yelery expressed heartfelt gratitude to the directors, organizers, speakers, funders, and volunteers for their dedication in making the 18th AICCS at IIM Indore a success, highlighting the importance of continued research, dialogue, and collaboration on China studies. Over the next two days, the conference will host extensive panel discussions on themes including: Current Discourses in Chinese Studies; Doing Business in/with China: Voices from Indian Business Leaders; Tariff Wars vs. Trade-offs: Can India and China Find a Common Ground?; Rewiring Globalization: Trade, Technology, and Sustainability; The China Factor in a Multipolar World; and China’s Technological Advances and Trade Restrictions, among others.

The institute has also been ranked 13th globally in career progression and has secured the First Rank among all the B-schools in India in this parameter. The institute has been ranked 96th globally in the FT EMBA Rankings 2025.

The FT EMBA Rankings evaluate programmes on multiple criteria, including salary today, salary increase, career progress, work experience, alumni network, diversity, international exposure, faculty qualifications, research, and ESG performance. IIM Indore’s PGPMX stands out for its flexible two-year, alternate-weekend format, which enables working professionals to pursue a world-class education without pausing their careers. With classes conducted at IIM Indore’s Mumbai Campus, the programme’s rigorous and globally benchmarked curriculum integrates classroom learning with industry projects, experiential modules, and an international immersion, encouraging effective leadership, strategic thinking, and innovation. “Our participants come from diverse sectors, including banking, consulting, IT, engineering, financial services, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and real estate.

This recognition reaffirms the global relevance and impact of PGPMX, highlighting its role in accelerating professional growth, enhancing leadership capabilities, and delivering tangible career outcomes. With this achievement, IIM Indore strengthens its position among the world’s top EMBA programmes and remains committed to delivering transformative learning experiences for mid-to-senior professionals.

    "content": "IIM Indore hosts “Sport and Business Conference 2.0” – IIM Indore IIM Indore hosts “Sport and Business Conference 2.0” Home News And Events IIM Indore hosts “Sport and Business Conference 2.0” navigate to IIM Indore hosts “Sport and Business Conference 2.0” A powerful confluence of sport, academia, and industry The Indian Institute of Management Indore (IIM Indore) successfully hosted the Sport and Business Conference 2.0 on October 9–10, 2025, reaffirming its role as a leading hub for cross-disciplinary dialogue that bridges the worlds of sports, academia, and business. Conducted in collaboration with Taylor & Francis as the academic partner, Revsportz as the media partner, and GPEC-X UK as the knowledge partner, the two-day conference drew an eclectic mix of scholars, industry experts, athletes, journalists, and policymakers to deliberate on the evolving relationship between sports and business, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for India as a potential global sporting powerhouse. The conference was inaugurated by IIM Indore’s Director, Prof. Himanshu Rai. Chief Guest Padma Bhushan Shri Pullela Gopichand,  India’s Chief National Badminton Coach; Prof. Vijay Pereira, Founder and Managing Director of GPEC-X UK; Dr. Boria Majumdar, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Revsportz; Prof. Nalin Mehta, political scientist, journalist, and writer; and Mr. Ashok Namboodiri, a global media and sports business leader, were also present on this occasion. Prof. Rai, in his inaugural address, highlighted how the intersection of sport and management offers unique lessons in leadership, resilience, and performance. He drew upon India’s timeless philosophical and cultural wisdom, and emphasized that true readiness for such a global event transcends infrastructure, finance, or policy, and instead lies in the triad of Sahasa, Buddhi, and Kridā – i.e., courage guided by wisdom, and the joyful, disciplined spirit of play. “India already possesses the vision, strength, and harmony required to inspire the world”, he said. On blending sports with business, he said that sport is a unifying force, capable of mobilizing youth, inspiring national pride, and projecting India’s power, while business provides the infrastructure, capital, and policy framework to scale these ambitions. Highlighting India’s growing presence in diverse disciplines, he insisted that the nation already has the talent, vision, and political will to transform sporting excellence into national strength and international influence. Shri Pullela Gopichand remarked that sports have undergone significant evolution over the years, urging educators, policymakers, and institutions to focus not merely on producing champions but on nurturing physical literacy and inclusivity from a young age. He emphasized that true success in sports education is not determined by the best performer in class but by the positive experience of the last person in the class. “We should think not of how many are playing,” he said, “but of how many are not.” He said that the nation must reconnect with that purity while taking a calibrated and introspective view of its current systems. He concluded with a powerful message on resilience, noting that “the bigger the challenges you overcome, the stronger your mind becomes,” urging all stakeholders to embrace both the simplicity and the strength that sport inherently teaches. Prof. Vijay Pereira shared the essence of collaboration between academia and industry. He emphasized the need for “knowledge ecosystems” that integrate academic rigor with practical realities, urging scholars to focus on research that influences policy and drives sustainable sports business models. Dr. Boria Majumdar, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Revsportz, reminded the audience that sports in India are no longer just a spectacle but a serious avenue for business innovation, media evolution, and national identity-building. Adding further depth to the day’s proceedings were two thought-provoking plenary addresses. Prof. Nalin Mehta spoke about the evolving politics and media narratives around Indian sport. He highlighted how sport has become a mirror of India’s social aspirations and its global image, suggesting that the road to 2036 is as much about nation-building as it is about athletic excellence. Mr. Ashok Namboodiri shared insights into the rapidly transforming global sports economy, where technology, fan engagement, and data analytics are redefining how sports are consumed and monetized. A special session and a workshop were also conducted during the conference. The first session, led by Dr. Boria Majumdar on the topic “Sports Media and the Way Ahead”, examined how digital media is reshaping athlete narratives and sports journalism. He argued for a more responsible and nuanced media environment, one that empowers athletes and enhances the credibility of sports storytelling. Prof. Vijay Edward Pereira’s workshop titled “No Easy Road to Publication – How Not to Irritate the Editors” offered young researchers practical insights into the world of academic publishing, from crafting submissions to handling reviewer feedback constructively. The conference also witnessed three panel discussions that blended academic inquiry with real-world insights. First panel discussion on “Practitioners and Sports”, moderated by Ms. Taruka Srivastav, Founder of The Playknox, brought together luminaries including Mr. Sushil Doshi, Padma Shri awardee and veteran cricket commentator; Mr. Akshat Khamparia, International Master; Mr. Ashok Namboodiri; and Prof. Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, Vice Provost at the University of Denver. The conversation centered around the business of sports broadcasting, athlete branding, and the challenges of maintaining authenticity in a highly commercialized sports world. The second panel discussion focused on “Academics and Sports” and featured leading scholars, including Prof. Julia Balogun, Dean of the University of Liverpool Management School; Prof. David Cockayne, University of Liverpool, UK; Prof. Soudeep Deb, IIM Bangalore; Prof. Shovan Chowdhury, IIM Kozhikode; and Prof. Sunny Jeong, Wittenberg University. The panel underscored the importance of data analytics, interdisciplinary research, and evidence-based policymaking in shaping future sports strategies. The third panel on “Healthcare and Sports” featured Prof. Vijay Pereira, Mr. Vinod Mukundan from Aktivolabs, and Prof. D. N. Venkatesh from the Goa Institute of Management. The discussion explored how advancements in sports medicine, wellness technology, and data-driven health monitoring can transform athlete development and longevity. The second day of the conference showcased its own academic rigor, with parallel track presentations spanning multiple themes, including International Business and Sports, Finance, CSR, Ethics, and Performance Analytics. These sessions reflected the vibrancy of emerging research in the field and the diverse perspectives scholars are bringing to sport management studies. With over two dozen international and national thought leaders sharing their expertise, IIM Indore’s Sport and Business Conference 2.0 reinforced the idea that the future of sports lies not only in athletic prowess but in the power of research, strategy, and innovation. As India aspires to Olympic glory, the conference served as both a mirror and a roadmap, reflecting the country’s current standing and its next steps. Previous Next"

The programme has been accredited by the Association of MBAs, London (4th and 5th Year). It is a unique and creative programme meant for young students with managerial and leadership aspirations. Through the IPM, IIM Indore seeks to attract young students, and mould them as outstanding leaders through a world-class education. IPM is aimed at students who have passed out of class XII/Higher Secondary or equivalent from schools across India. Mission To produce contextually relevant, socially-conscious managers and leaders with a foundation of world class education in social sciences followed by management education. Learning Goals Given the nature of the programme learning goals of IPM are split into those for the first 3 years and the last two years. Learning goals for the first three years of the programme: The IPM will enable students to: Goal 1 Demonstrate language skills Goal 2 Demonstrate oral communication skills Goal 3 Demonstrate knowledge of foundational subjects for management studies Goal 4 Demonstrate an awareness of ethical understanding Learning goals of the last two years Last two years of the programme are at Post-graduate level and the IPM students are mixed with the PGP programme students and they go through the same set of courses as the PGP programme.

Courses in Psychology, Sociology and Political Science along with courses in Economics provide an understanding of the core disciplines on which the study of management is based. Courses in Humanities, Literature and Fine Arts provide breadth and perspective. A combination of analytical rigour and wide exposure equips IPM students for leadership roles and positions of responsibility in different sectors. After 3 years of intensive study of foundational disciplines, the IPM students train as managers along with the students of the Institute’s 2-year Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP), undertaking the same course package in management studies in years 4 and 5. IPM students are required to complete a social internship at the end of year 2, and a business internship between years 4 and 5.

    "content": "Rural Engagement Programme (REP) – IIM Indore Rural Engagement Programme (REP) Home Rural Engagement Programme (REP) navigate to Belonging to the prestigious family of the IIMs, IIM Indore has rarely, if ever, curtailed its efforts to provide its students with a rich, practical and socially oriented approach to learning, irrespective of the precedent set by the other members. This aspect was showcased with the introduction of the Rural Engagement Programme (REP) in 2009 as a part of the main curriculum of the first year post-graduate programme. Rural Engagement Programme (REP) is a unique initiative that was instituted with an objective to sensitize the budding managers and entrepreneurs of this Institute towards the various schemes undertaken by the government in villages and to study and analyze their execution and effectiveness. Spread over a week, across several districts in Madhya Pradesh, the programme’s main objective is to be an eye opener as it provides insights on the various dimensions of district level administration, focusing primarily on the policy administration and the execution gaps, while dispelling several stereotypes associated with the rural population at large. The Concept The entire set of participants is uniformly divided into groups of 10 each, based on their own choices. The entire programme is organized in coordination with the Madhya Pradesh Mantralaya, Bhopal. However, coordination with the Block Development Officers and Nodal Officers about their travel itinerary is left to the students. The entire week is characterized by visits to various blocks in the district where students critically analyze the execution plan of numerous government schemes and survey villages to observe the actual level of implementation. Through this process, they assess the challenges that are faced in the execution of the schemes while identifying operational gaps that could possibly be bridged through better planning and management strategies. The students submit a report of their analysis and make suitable recommendations that can prove to be helpful, not only at the rural administration level but also the district level. Benefits to the participants The entire programme is oriented towards ensuring that the participants get a chance to apply their classroom learnings to a real-time environment. Additionally, the programme offers the students a chance to explore the rural markets and identify implementation gaps or business opportunities, which can help fill these gaps. The programme also sensitizes students towards social issues, which are prevalent in such societies and learn that the government might not always be wrong and it is sometimes about getting a different perspective."

As the students prepare to assume greater responsibility in life by joining the high ranks of the corporate world, the Himalayas give them the opportunity to reflect on the one and a half year spent in the Institute and the importance of this education in future. The Concept Started in 2010 on a trial basis, this unique course involved just 30 students who were initially sent to Nainital for a week-long excursion. Given the emphatic response of the participants, the course was formally inducted into the second year curriculum as a 4-credit course. Every year since then, the programme, coordinated through India hikes, takes place across various popular trek routes like Kedarkantha, Dayara-Barsu , Bedni-Bugyal and Nainital. The students go through multiple rounds of training, focusing on adventure sports and real-life challenges, designed to test their managerial and leadership skills. From rock-climbing, rappelling and river rafting, to yoga and pranayama, the Himalayan Outbound Programme offers a mix of physical and psychological experiential tasks for the students. To elucidate, the range of activities include basic survival training – cooking competitions, firewood collection, setting up the tent, and various mountain tasks where teams strategize and perform together, which tests their leadership skills and team dynamics. The second leg of training entails engaging the students in social work by helping villages close to the base camps by providing an innovative solution to their basic problems through the application of their classroom learning. The training is continuously evaluated by the members of the India Hikes team with each student being graded on process compliance, leadership skill, out-of-the-box thinking, quality of work, initiative, team work, timely completion of tasks and overall capabilities. Benefits to the Participants As mentioned earlier, the students get an opportunity to explore the Himalayas while bonding with their peers before they set out to pursue their managerial careers. In addition, the programme sensitizes the participants towards being more aware of their natural surroundings while discovering their own selves in the process. All in all, the programme shapes and develops the future managers to face challenges, work in a team, stay rooted to the problem at hand, while living the moment. It is a week that remains etched in the minds of all the participants of IIM Indore and teaches them the importance of managing their own self, their strengths as well as their weaknesses before they set out to manage others.

    "content": "Centre of Wellness and Inclusion – IIM Indore Centre of Wellness and Inclusion Home Student’s Corner Centre of Wellness and Inclusion navigate to Clubs Events Life at IIM Indore Student Achievement Student Body Wall of Dreams Centre of Wellness and Inclusion The Centre of Wellness and Inclusion (CWI) (earlier known as “Office of Disability Centre (CWI))” was established in August 2014 to address the needs of students with disabilities on the IIMI campus. It is the single point of contact for students with disabilities. These disabilities include visual/hearing impairment, locomotor disabilities, and intellectual disabilities, and other disabilities such as Thalassemia. Our goal is to provide students with disabilities an environment where they can learn and perform to their full potential. CWI works with Programme Offices and faculty to ensure that students’ learning experiences are excellent both inside and outside the classroom. Please read our Equal Opportunity Policy for more details: Equal Opportunity Policy Diversity & Inclusion Accommodation Request Process Once a student accepts an offer of admission, we send a Reasonable Accommodation Form to help us organize reasonable accommodations before the term begins. All students with disabilities are required to submit the form. The accommodations are provided throughout their stay at IIMI. Assessments After we receive student accommodation forms, we conduct individual need assessment session. The assessment is done well before the term begins and is conducted by a specialist external organization. Information obtained during the assessment include: Nature of disability and its impact on education Any medications students are taking, physiotherapy, etc. Previous support at their schools and colleges Access to assistive technology Appropriate academic and non-academic support (for example, accessible classrooms, accessible hostel rooms and furniture, exam accommodations, in-class support, etc.) Based on the assessment report, the requirements of students are shared with concerned departments. We also send emails to teaching faculty before the commencement of each term about students’ needs during classes and exams. Academic Accommodations Academic accommodations are legally mandated modifications and adjustments to ensure that a student with a disability gets an equal opportunity to benefit from the educational process. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis and depend on a student’s disability and its functional impacts. Academic accommodations may include: Modifications to the curriculum and examinations Provision of accessible course materials Scheduling of classes in accessible classrooms with appropriate seating Other modifications that enable students to perform to their full potential Students are required to inform CWI as soon as possible of any problems or delays in obtaining academic accommodation and services. Accessible course material Course materials, including textbooks, handouts, documents, and exams, are provided to students in accessible formats such as MS Word, PDF, etc. Please note that the accessible materials are intended to be used by the eligible student only and not to be duplicated and shared with friends, peers, posted online, etc. In case of any breach, the student will no longer be eligible to receive the material in accessible formats. Extra sessions or Tutoring Extra sessions or Tutors are provided to students who require additional academic support in a specific course(s). CWI requests students to contact the course faculty for extra sessions or tutoring sessions. Accommodations Reasonable exam accommodations allow students with disabilities to represent their knowledge and perform to their potential. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis and may include, but are not limited to: Accessible exam room Quiet location / distraction-reduced room Compensatory time Question paper in an accessible format (large font, soft copy, etc.) Scribe Accessible exam room We ensure that exams are scheduled in accessible rooms for students with locomotor disabilities. Quiet location / distraction-reduced room A separate room is provided for students using accommodations such as a scribe, a reader, or assistive devices that would distract others. Students with ADHD and anxiety disorders are also provided a separate exam room upon request. Compensatory time Students with a disability who request extra time during the assessment are provided compensatory time of twenty minutes per hour, as per government guidelines. A student may request compensatory time over and above the specified limit. In that case, the Committee on Diversity & Inclusion evaluates the request on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature and severity of impairment. Question paper in an accessible format Question papers are provided in an accessible format accessible. For example, we request faculty to make the font size larger, provide a soft copy of the exam, etc. Students are required to inform CWI about the font size that they are comfortable reading. For a soft copy of the question paper, the student must request faculty to provide the paper in the format desired by them (MS Word, PDF, etc.). Faculty provide the soft copy of the question paper to the Programme offices, preferably in a password-encrypted file on a pen drive, which the Programme office opens for the student at the time of the exam. Wi-Fi on the desktop is disabled. Students cannot bring their cell phones, pen drives, electronic devices, or any material to the exam room. The Programme Office or concerned staff retrieves the answer paper and then deletes the question paper from the desktop once the exam is over. If a student needs to use any additional assistive device(s) to read/write an exam, s/he will be allowed to do so with prior permission from the Faculty. Scribe Students with severe visual impairments, spinal cord injury, or limited mobility of hand/arm may need a scribe to write their exams. Students are requested to share the quiz/exam schedule with CWI or concerned office so that we can arrange a scribe. Please note that CWI/office must be given at least two weeks’ notice to make necessary arrangements because finding a scribe might take time. Students are encouraged to meet the scribe a day before or two hours before the exam to discuss the methods of working. During the exam, students should clearly dictate their answers (including punctuation, grammar, or any specific course-related terminology) to the scribe. The scribe is not responsible for rephrasing or organizing the student’s answers. At any time, students may review the answers written by the scribe or ask the scribe to read the answers out loud. Guidelines for scribe Placement Placements are facilitated by the Career Services office (Placement office) and the Students’ placement committee. Students are advised to meet the Placement head/representative of the placement committee if they need more clarity about the placement process or if they want to apply to specific companies. The placement committee approaches recruiters from specific companies when desired by the student. CWI sends the DA candidates list about the needs of students during the placement process. Sensitization The Centre of Wellness and Inclusion (CWI) is dedicated to fostering a culture at the Institute where students with disabilities receive support when they need it – as a matter of right, not as charity. As part of this commitment, a session on disability awareness and inclusion is held for students during Orientation Week.  The Institute takes any form of discrimination against persons with disabilities, including rude or insensitive behavior, extremely seriously. CWI also conducts various events and speaker series in association with student clubs to raise awareness among the IIMI community. Any discrimination against Persons with Disabilities or rude/insensitive behavior is taken very seriously. Infrastructure In terms of infrastructure, most of the campus is accessible, and IIMI’s Estate Office continuously works towards making the entire campus friendly towards those with disabilities. Lecture rooms and faculty blocks are wheelchair accessible. A few hostel rooms have been modified to ensure students using a wheelchair can access them easily. In case an escort needs to stay with the student, accommodation is provided for the escort. Caretakers are also assigned based on individual needs. We provide motorized wheelchairs for students with locomotor disabilities. Transportation Transport facility is provided for visual and locomotor disability students for classroom, depending on the severity of their disability. Mental Health, and Wellness The Centre of Wellness and Inclusion (CWI) is dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment that prioritizes the well-being of all campus members, including those with disabilities and mental health concerns. Our aim is to proactively and compassionately identify, address, and support individuals’ mental health needs. The Centre of Wellness and Inclusion (CWI) is committed to promoting mental health awareness and supporting students in managing mental health challenges. We provide information about available resources, including the Medical Centre, on-campus counsellors, and 24/7 access to YourDost online counselling services. Trained professionals, Counsellors are available on campus twice a week and offer psychological assessments and interventions to help students cope with issues like stress, anxiety, sadness, addiction, isolation, low academic performance, and absenteeism. Students are encouraged to proactively seek help and can schedule appointments with counsellors via email. Additionally, CWI regularly shares newsletters and organizes workshops to raise awareness about mental health; students are advised to attend these sessions and stay informed. For further support, students may also reach out directly to the CWI office, and we will coordinate appropriate assistance. The Centre of Wellness and Inclusion (CWI) also emphasizes the holistic health of students, recognizing its importance for both physical and mental health. A number of sports facilities are available on campus to encourage an active lifestyle, including a cricket stadium, tennis courts, football court, swimming pool, indoor and outdoor badminton courts, and gym. In addition, tranquil outdoor spaces such as the Spiritual Garden, Resonance (a sound garden), and walking trails provide students with opportunities for relaxation and rejuvenation. CWI encourages all students to make full use of these resources and take active steps toward improving their health.

In that moment of sheer chaos, when the queues for the printer are interminable, and the calls to the professor to extend the deadline incessant, the peace and quiet of the place become irrelevant. Life at the IIM Indore campus may be hectic, frenetic, downright hair-splittingly tiring but it is never dull. Between the many assignments, classes, positions of responsibility, committees, activity and interest clubs we are gainfully (or otherwise) employed on a regular basis. Since it is a completely residential campus, with accommodation for all the participants of the courses, it creates camaraderie and long-term friendships. The flip side of this, however, cannot be ignored. As the students live on campus, we have classes till and at ungodly hours, midnight sessions and exams, and constant pressure to deliver. In all of this, the one constant that remains is that the campus never sleeps. At the same time, participants also engage in things that normal students do such as enjoying sports, an activity that is facilitated by courts for various sports and a fully equipped sports complex. Birthday celebrations have become iconic on campus with more people than can be counted involved in wishing the birthday boy. The celebration of culturally diverse festivals, late-night partying, going out to the city in droves, long rides on highways around the lovely campus and drives to nearby destinations, among other things, make up the collage of life on campus. A Typical Day The classes begin at the early hour of 8:45 AM and all are expected to be punctual since there is a premium to be paid for tardiness. As a result, there is a mad scramble in the mess as well as on the way up to the academic block. Not only does one have to be on time, but also be prepared for class by having studied the readings that have been circulated in advance. The 75-minute long sessions, punctuated by 15 minute tea breaks occupy most of our days. However, the arrival of the evening signals the beginning of the more pleasurable activities on campus right from playing a sport of your choice, to leisurely walks around campus and to visiting the city and the many eating joints using the institute bus. One of the most distinctive features of the campus is that students run most of the things. The Students’ Activities Council (SAC) is the channel through which the student body carries out most of its endeavours. Elected by the participants each year, the SAC is the source of administration, merrymaking and entertainment. The Cultural Committee, known as the CulCom, organizes all the celebrations, dinners, bonfires, parties, antaksharis, dumb charades and many other activities. The student body also runs its very own shop known as the PI shop, which caters to the daily needs of the students. Not only does it stock basic groceries, it also provides hands-on experience on running a business – a true learning experience as far as management is concerned. In addition, the students run a fast food and juice joint called Juices and More, more commonly known as JAM. Known for its freshly prepared juices and fast food, JAM is also the place where most of us meet up in the evenings, have conversations, watch cricket matches and generally relax. Most importantly, life at IIM Indore is an exhilarating and unexpected ride. Each and every member of the student community adds his/her own flavour and spin to this place. With so many people, the campus then becomes a veritable cosmos of myriad hues. Gallery Centre of Wellness and Inclusion Clubs Events Student Achievement Student Body Wall of Dreams"

She received this award for her initiative called Drive on My Own (a car driving solutions provider for people with reduced mobility). She received a citation, Rs. 1 Lakh as prize money and a goody bag. As per the Dr. Batra’s website declaring the results of the awards, given the state of public transportation services in the country for the differently-abled, Anita wanted to learn driving to be able to travel with dignity. However, none of the thousands of driving schools she contacted were willing to teach her as they were not qualified to teach the differently-abled. She had to eventually learn driving from her mother. Having faced so much trouble herself finding a driving school, Anita realized there might be more people like her who can be in need. With this noble thought in mind she started a driving school ‘On My Own’ in April 2018 to teach driving to the differently-abled. Through ‘On My Own’ Anita has helped 52 differently-abled people learn driving. Along with driving lessons, Anita also works on building the self-confidence of her students and spreading positivity in their lives. She also runs ‘On My Own Home Stay’ which is a hostel facility for her students living at a distance to stay and complete their training. ‘It feels great to turn into a real entrepreneur after teaching and preaching about entrepreneurship for the past 12 years’, she says. Previously, Anita also received the title ‘the girl on four wheels’ at the India Inclusion Summit and became the first-ever from IIMs to receive the Inclusion Fellowship ( https://indiainclusionsummit.com/tif2019/ ). Her other company Inkpothub ( www.inkpothub.com ) has been selected for the accelerator program at ISB Mohali. IIM Indore congratulates Anita for her achievement and wishes her luck for her future endeavours. Previous Next"

The alumni belonging to the senior-most batch did the honours of cutting the cake and the room was buzzing with energy as old friends met once again. In the faculty-alumni brunch that followed, conversations hit off without a beat lost. Stories and anecdotes were shared, brains stormed and advice sought. The Annual Entrepreneurship Meet (AEM) was also scheduled on Day 3. The third edition of the meet, organised by E-cell in association with Alumni Committee, aimed at fostering a culture of entrepreneurship in the Institute. An informal interactive session was also held, with Abhijeet Singh, PGP of 2014 batch, CEO and partner in Nineten- a business wing of Endohaveli as the speaker. Endohaveli is a Facebook group of 47000 dynamic dentists. Also, Abhijeet is International Certified Business and Executive Coach (Affiliated to Certified Coaches Alliance, Canada). He was joined by Dr. Rahul Bisht, a young creative mind from KGMC, dentist by profession and Founder of Endohaveli.

The event brought together distinguished academicians and thought leaders from 17 premier partner institutions across 13 countries, including Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom, Norway, Ireland, Germany, the United States, France, Brazil, South Africa, Sweden, Australia, and Romania. The gathering served as a vibrant forum for deepening institutional alliances, discussing the role of innovation and technology in advancing global education, and co-creating pathways for a more sustainable and equitable future. In his welcome address, Prof. Himanshu Rai highlighted IIM Indore’s continued evolution as a global institution deeply engaged in addressing some of the world’s most complex and pressing challenges. He spoke about how the institute is tackling various “wicked problems”, ranging from income disparity and rural issues to urban challenges and environmental problems – through initiatives and collaborations that transcend geographical and disciplinary boundaries. Prof. Rai emphasized that IIM Indore’s collaborations are not just academic exchanges but enduring relationships built on shared values and a collective commitment to societal progress. He reiterated the Institute’s goal of shaping leaders who are not only competent professionals but also compassionate change-makers equipped to navigate uncertainty and drive meaningful impact. A highlight of the event was the engaging panel discussion on “AI for Sustainability,” which featured an exceptional line-up of global experts: Dr. Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, Vice Provost for Internationalization at the University of Denver; Prof. Andrea Sianesi, Dean at MIP Politecnico di Milano Graduate School of Business; Dr. Julia Christine Balogun, Dean at the University of Liverpool; and Dr. Simon Fraser, International Engagement Lead and Principal Lecturer at Aberdeen Business School, Robert Gordon University.

The panelists examined how universities can serve as catalysts for responsible technological advancement, ensuring that AI not only enhances efficiency but also contributes to solving global social and environmental challenges. The dialogue centered on the crucial role of education in fostering a future where technology and humanity advance in tandem. The day also featured a series of thought-provoking presentations that highlighted IIM Indore’s distinctive initiatives, aimed at driving sustainable development, cultural preservation, and leadership through experiential learning. Prof. Shruti Tewari (Dean – Research) shared how ANVESHAN, IIM Indore’s Centre of Excellence on Waste Management and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), adopts an interdisciplinary approach to translating research into real-world impact, as well as its efforts to train policymakers and urban leaders in sustainable waste management practices.

The event was inaugurated by IIM Indore’s Director, Prof. Himanshu Rai. Prof. Nobin Thomas, Chair – PGPHRM was also present on this occasion. In his inaugural address, Prof. Rai challenged conventional definitions of leadership, reflecting on how influence alone cannot be the sole qualifier of a leader. Drawing from history and mythology, he mentioned that leadership should be anchored in moral responsibility. He emphasised that truth and righteousness are not always identical, urging future leaders to cultivate the wisdom to differentiate between what is factually correct and what is ethically just. Introducing his Be–Know–Do framework, he urged the audience to Be responsible and value-driven, Know their identity beyond temporary titles, and Do what is right even when it is inconvenient. He concluded by inviting participants to treat Mimamsa not merely as an event but as a space for introspection and transformation. The day’s discussions commenced with a panel on the theme – Reimagining Learning and Culture – Empowering Agile, AI-ready Talent, moderated by Prof. Jatin Pandey, Faculty in the OB&HRM Area at IIM Indore. The conversation featured Mr. Gautam Duggal, (SVP, Citi), Mr. Abraham Zachariah (SVP, HSBC), Mr. Sahil Nayar (Senior Associate Director, KPMG), and Mr. Manu S. Varma (Head HR, ITC), who reflected on the growing interplay between artificial intelligence and human intelligence in organisational decision-making. The panel agreed that as automation replaces transactional roles, the value of human contribution increasingly lies in contextual judgement, creativity and empathy. What emerged strongly was the belief that mindset now outweighs mere skillset, and emotional intelligence may well become the defining differentiator of leadership in an AI-accelerated era. The dialogue then shifted to the evolving role of higher education in modern society in a conversation moderated by Prof. Swati Ghulyani, Faculty in the OB&HRM Area at IIM Indore. This panel themed Universities of the Future: Balancing Tradition, Technology & Global Relevance was joined by Dr. Paul Wilson, Principal of Madras Christian College, and Dr. D. Pandiaraja, Principal and Director of Thiagarajar College, Madurai, who reflected on the challenges of balancing rootedness in tradition with adaptability to global expectations. They advocated for an educational paradigm that moves beyond instruction to facilitation, from rote to reflection, and from curriculum-based delivery to context-based discovery. The speakers reiterated that universities today must nurture global citizens with local grounding, capable of interpretation rather than imitation. Furthering the continuum between academia and industry, Prof. Ranjeet Nambudiri, Faculty in the OB&HRM Area at IIM Indore, moderated a discussion themed Building Future-Ready Organizations: Harnessing IR, Technology, and People-Centric Leadership, featuring Mr. Rengarajan Alagar, Regional HR Integration Manager at Maersk, Dr. Rajen Mehrotra, Former Senior Employers’ Specialist at the ILO South Asia, Mr. Yashwant Chauhan, CHRM and Deputy HR Head JLPL at GAIL, and Ms. Crystal Pinto, Vice President – Learning and Development at Reliance Nippon Life Insurance. The group reflected on the rapid shifts in workforce expectations, emphasising the need for organisations to humanise systems without compromising efficiency. They underscored that policy, governance and culture must evolve simultaneously to enable agility without eroding dignity. The conclave culminated in a panel on mentorship and campus life, moderated by Prof. Amitabh Kodwani, Faculty in the OB&HRM Area at IIM Indore. The session featured Dr. Kanika K. Ahuja, Acting Principal of Lady Shri Ram College, Dr. Jossy P. George, Director Christ University, and Dr. P. B. Harathi, Principal of PSGR Krishnammal College for Women, who reflected on the changing aspirations and anxieties of the youth. They highlighted that while infrastructure and pedagogy continue to evolve, the essence of education lies in emotional scaffolding and ethical grounding. Mentorship, they agreed, must evolve from supervision to partnership. Mimamsa 2025 concluded not with prescriptions but with provocations. Rather than offering quick solutions, the conclave left attendees with enduring questions — How do we build technologically advanced yet deeply humane institutions? Can agility coexist with reflection? Can ambition grow without eroding empathy? The event reaffirmed IIM Indore’s belief that leadership must be measured not only by what it achieves, but by what it enables — not just in systems, but within people. Previous Next"

The event was inaugurated by the Institute’s Director, Prof. Himanshu Rai, and witnessed the presence of distinguished Hindi language experts who shared their insights on the language’s rich tradition, contemporary relevance, and future possibilities. In his inaugural address, Prof. Rai emphasized IIM Indore’s commitment to promoting Indian languages, particularly Hindi. He said that while a country is shaped by its population and demography, it is culture that builds a nation and gives it its true identity, and at the heart of this culture lies language. Quoting scriptures, he noted that language has been accorded the status of a mother. Just as a mother nurtures and sustains life, language preserves and strengthens civilization. He emphasized that Hindi should be embraced with pride rather than hesitation, as education in one’s mother tongue accelerates knowledge and understanding. Prof. Rai urged everyone to pledge to protect and preserve Indian languages. The highlight of the event was the panel discussion on the theme “Hindi Journalism: Challenges and Opportunities.” The panel comprised Shri Nitishwar Kumar, IAS, Additional Secretary, Government of India; Shri Jai Prakash Pandey, Editor of Sahitya Tak and Sahitya Aajtak at the TV Today/India Today Group; and Prof. (Dr.) Vartika Nanda, Head of the Journalism Department at Lady Shri Ram College, University of Delhi. The discussion was moderated by Prof. Rai. Shri Jai Prakash Pandey stated that the greatest strength of Hindi journalism today lies in social media, which has provided every segment of society the opportunity to express themselves. He noted that Hindi, supported by other Indian languages, is reaching a wider audience through translations and digital platforms. While the government has made efforts to promote Hindi, he emphasized that the real test lies in how widely the language is actually used. Simplification is necessary for clarity of communication, he added, but it must be done without compromising the richness of the language. Shri Nitishwar Kumar highlighted the scientific foundation and cultural depth of Hindi. He explained that the Hindi alphabets and letters are deeply connected to life and culture, and that knowledge of Sanskrit makes learning other languages easier. He described Hindi’s role through literature and cinema as instrumental in shaping national identity, and noted that Hindi has absorbed influences from many civilizations, thereby enriching itself. Prof. Vartika Nanda emphasized that the true strength of Hindi lies in the people of India, and the ones who speak Hindi. Once considered secondary to foreign languages, Hindi has proven itself over time and created new opportunities. She said that simplification is not always necessary, and that richness matters more. She expressed concern over careless mixing of languages, and stated that Hindi’s real power lies in preserving its dignity and cultural honor. On this occasion, the tenth issue of the Institute’s Hindi magazine Gyaan Shikhar was released by the esteemed guests. The issue featured research articles, poems, essays, and creative expressions by members of the IIM Indore community, and was widely appreciated by all present. Winners of the various competitions organized under the Hindi Fortnight were also felicitated at the event. These competitions provided students and staff with an opportunity to showcase their talent in Hindi writing, debates, and poetry recitation. The Rajbhasha Department also presented a review of the use of Hindi at the Institute and suggested measures for further increasing its application in the future. The entire event created an atmosphere filled with pride for the Hindi language and its vitality. The panel discussion gave the audience a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing Hindi journalism. Previous Next"

Encouraging students to embrace these values, he stated, “The world will recognize you not just for what you achieve, but for the values you uphold and the impact you create.” He urged the graduates to remain fearless in their pursuits, adaptable in their approach, and steadfast in their commitment to making a difference. Prof. Rai also highlighted the remarkable achievements and milestones of IIM Indore over the past year, reaffirming the institute’s standing as a center of excellence. From global accreditations and prestigious rankings to groundbreaking collaborations and student accomplishments, he underscored how the institute continues to shape future leaders who drive innovation, progress, and ethical leadership. In his inspiring Convocation Address, Chess Grandmaster Mr. Viswanathan Anand shared profound insights on learning, unlearning, and the unpredictable nature of success. Drawing from his personal experiences, he emphasized that true mastery comes not just from acquiring knowledge but from continuously adapting, refining, and even discarding what no longer serves a purpose. Mr. Anand spoke about the importance of planning—how we meticulously chart out strategies, prepare ourselves to execute them, and yet, in reality, often find ourselves not using those plans at all. He highlighted that while structured preparation is essential, true success lies in the ability to pivot, rethink, and embrace new possibilities when circumstances change. He urged the graduates to remain flexible in their approach, open to change, and willing to adapt to challenges. He also delved into the concepts of success and failure, underscoring that setbacks are an integral part of any journey. Just as in chess, where a single move can change the course of the game, life, too, requires resilience and the ability to bounce back stronger. He encouraged students to view failures as stepping stones rather than obstacles, learning from each experience to refine their strategies. Additionally, Mr. Anand stressed the importance of taking breaks—not just in their careers but in their daily routines. “Rest and reflection are vital for clarity, creativity, and long-term success. Constant motion without pause can lead to burnout, while well-timed breaks allow the mind to reset and approach challenges with renewed energy”, he said. Through his words, Mr. Anand left the graduates with a powerful message: success is not about rigidly sticking to a plan but about staying agile, learning from every experience, and embracing the journey with resilience and adaptability. This year’s convocation saw 788 participants receive their degrees from the following programmes: Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) Post Graduate Programme in Human Resource Management (PGPHRM) Five-Year Integrated Programme in Management (IPM) (including BA degree recipients) Executive Post Graduate Programme in Management (EPGP) Post Graduate Programme in Management for Working Executives (PGPMX – Mumbai) Doctoral Programme in Management (DPM) Executive Doctoral Programme in Management (EDPM) Adding to the momentous occasion, Gold Medalists were also felicitated for their outstanding academic and overall performance, symbolizing the highest level of excellence achieved by the graduating class.

The conference was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Prof. Rai, in his inaugural address, emphasized the importance of extending the traditional “3Rs” of waste management—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle—to include a fourth crucial element: Refuse. He advocated that while people are often encouraged to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste, it is equally important to refuse the unnecessary use of products that contribute to waste generation. By refusing items that are not essential, we can address the root of the problem and minimize waste creation right at the source. Prof. Rai also highlighted IIM Indore’s initiatives in this area, such as promoting a zero-waste campus, implementing waste segregation, and encouraging sustainable practices across the institute, setting an example for others to follow. Speaking of ANVESHAN’s state-of-the-art facilities, Prof. Rai said that the Centre of Excellence will also support collaborations, mentorship, and training for startups and various stakeholders to drive impactful change.

Drawing from his work with the Colorado National Wastewater System, he shared insights on how wastewater surveillance was instrumental in monitoring and managing public health during the pandemic, using advanced testing methods like spit and pool testing. Prof. Raychaudhuri emphasized that achieving more sustainable outcomes requires doing less—conserving resources, minimizing consumption, and adopting a balanced approach to living. Prof. Andrea Sianesi, Dean, from Politecnico di Milano, spoke on “Fashion, Design, and Luxury Urban Circularity Framework”, showcasing innovative practices in Milan aimed at integrating sustainability into the luxury sector. He emphasized the significance of integrating sustainability-driven business models into organizations, especially within the fashion, luxury, and design sectors. He pointed out that developing a circular and environmentally sustainable industrial paradigm is essential due to its wide-reaching social and economic impacts. To achieve this, education for companies and professionals is mandatory to ensure clear, shared objectives that drive meaningful change. He highlighted that by sharing best practices, the public administration and individual organizations can strengthen Lombardy and Milan’s position as global pioneers in the creation of eco-sustainable business frameworks, setting benchmarks for the broader industry.

Her message was clear: for businesses and societies to thrive, the focus must be on building systems that support both personal wellbeing and sustainable growth, ensuring that innovation benefits not just individuals, but also communities and the larger ecosystem. The conference not only addressed waste management challenges but also served as a platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration. The conference also witnessed insightful paper presentations across three key tracks—Solid Waste Management, Sustainability, and SBM 2.0 (Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0). The conference brought together researchers and experts who shared their pioneering studies and strategies for driving sustainable waste management in urban settings. Through these tracks, the conference highlighted the importance of collaborative research and strategic implementation in creating waste-free urban ecosystems, reinforcing ANVESHAN’s mission to promote sustainable development and innovation in waste management practices. The competition was incredibly fierce, with numerous thought-provoking and impactful presentations showcasing innovative solutions and research.

These workshops are offered completely free of charge to the entire IIM Indore community, including students, faculty, staff, and even extending to the children and families of community members. This inclusive approach fosters a sense of unity and encourages participation from all generations. The event marks another significant step in IIM Indore’s ongoing efforts to integrate language learning into its broader educational mission. Previously, the institute also conducted workshops on the Oriya and Tamil languages. Prof. Rai, while addressing the gathering in Hindi, English, Sanskrit, and Bengali, emphasized the importance of languages in preserving and enriching India’s cultural landscape. He highlighted the unique contributions of both Sanskrit and Bengali in nurturing a deeper understanding of tradition, literature, and human expression. “Sanskrit is more than just an ancient language; it is the foundation upon which much of Indian philosophy, science, and literature have been built. It is a timeless treasure that encapsulates profound wisdom and knowledge”, he said. Sanskrit provides a lens through which we can view not only the past but also how those ancient insights remain relevant today. Learning this language is akin to embracing the intellectual heritage of India, he added. He also spoke about the beauty, depth, and emotional resonance of the Bengali language. “Bengali is not merely a language but a living embodiment of culture, history, and identity. Known for its sweetness, richness, and unique ability to express profound emotions, Bengali has left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. It is a language that speaks directly to the soul, with every word carrying a deep sense of warmth and connection,” he said. He further remarked on the literary legacy of Bengali, which has produced towering figures such as Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. “The Bengali language is renowned for its literature and songs, where each verse resonates with melody and meaning. Bengali’s grammar is simple and accessible, but its depth lies in its ability to express complex emotions with unmatched clarity. Every word in Bengali carries layers of meaning that make it a joy to speak, read, and listen to, he said. Sanskrit Language Instructor Mr. Pravesh Vaishnav mentioned that the Sanskrit workshop will immerse participants in the intricacies of this classical language, from its complex grammatical structures to its vast repository of philosophical texts. It aims to give learners a comprehensive understanding of Sanskrit’s enduring relevance and its capacity to foster logical thinking, philosophical inquiry, and creative expression. The Bengali workshop, led by Mr. Dilip Kumar Dutta, is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of the language while also allowing them to appreciate its cultural and literary richness. Participants will be exposed to Bengali literature, poetry, and music, providing them with a holistic understanding of the language and its place in Indian culture. Prof. Rai shared the broader purpose of the language workshops at IIM Indore, stating, “These workshops are not just about learning a new language; they are about connecting with a larger cultural and intellectual tradition”. By engaging with languages like Sanskrit and Bengali, we open ourselves up to new ways of thinking, to deeper forms of expression, and to the shared heritage that defines us as a nation. IIM Indore’s commitment to such initiatives is rooted in our belief that language is a powerful tool for education, empathy, and personal growth, he said. These workshops are a part of IIM Indore’s continued efforts to contribute to nation-building and preserve and encourage the use of our Indian languages. Prof. Rai noted that language is not just a means of communication but an integral part of our Indian identity.  “Our existence is indebted to the languages we speak and adopt. It is our duty to preserve and promote the diverse regional languages of India. These workshops not only provide a platform for language learning but also serve as a bridge to our roots and traditions,” he said. The workshops are not just about learning a new language. Participants who successfully complete the course are awarded a certificate of completion by the institute, recognizing their dedication and achievement.

Inaugurated by IIM Indore’s Director Prof. Himanshu Rai, the workshop aimed to equip 80 investigative officers (IOs) with crucial insights, best practices, and tools necessary to investigate and prevent cases of missing minors more effectively. Shri Manoj Kumar Srivastava, IPS, Additional Police Commissioner (Crime & Headquarters); and Shri Jagdish Dawar, IPS, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters), were also present on the occasion. Last year, IIM Indore collaborated with the Indore Police Commissionerate to address the critical issue of missing minors in the region. The project, initiated through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in July 2023, aimed to investigate the root causes behind the disappearance of minors, focusing on girls aged 13-17 from marginalized socio-economic backgrounds. Through archival research, case studies, and interviews with victims and police officers, IIM Indore’s team, led by Prof. Himanshu Rai and team members Prof. Shruti Tewari, Prof. Shivani Sharma and Mr. Naveen Krishna Rai, developed comprehensive recommendations. These aimed to enhance preventive measures, expedite recovery efforts, and support rehabilitation through awareness campaigns and community involvement, ensuring a safer environment for vulnerable adolescents. The KHOJ workshop, conducted by IIM Indore, aimed to provide specialized training to investigative officers based on the recommendations outlined in the institute’s comprehensive report on missing minors. This workshop was designed to equip officers with the knowledge and skills required to address the issue more effectively, focusing on understanding the psycho-social triggers, implementing preventive strategies, and enhancing recovery and rehabilitation processes. The training emphasized case-based learning, community outreach, and legal protocols, ensuring that investigative officers are better prepared to safeguard vulnerable adolescents and bring justice to affected families. Prof. Rai emphasized the institute’s dedication to social responsibility through academic research for public benefit. He outlined the collaboration with the police to tackle the critical issue of missing minors, stating, “The KHOJ workshop is an extension of our shared responsibility towards society. Our research-based recommendations have significantly aided the police in recovering minors. This workshop is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of investigative officers in handling such sensitive cases.” Prof. Rai described the initiative as a mission rather than a project, driven by alarming statistics. “The figures surrounding missing minors are concerning. To address this, we must unite in our efforts,” he said. He introduced the KHOJ framework, emphasizing Knowledge, Hope, Outreach, and Justice. “Knowledge helps us understand our goals and methods. Hope brings optimism to the lives of missing minors. Outreach involves community-wide efforts beyond just police work. Justice requires collective action to ensure fairness and resolution,” he explained. He encouraged officers to be bold and innovative, urging them to disregard naysayers and focus on making a meaningful impact. Mr. Srivastava also praised IIM Indore and its Director for their leadership and commitment to this initiative. “It is an honor to be here at IIM Indore. Prof. Rai’s leadership has contributed to numerous impactful initiatives. Today’s workshop is not just about learning but about implementing these lessons in real life, so we can better contribute to society in a proper, meaningful way,” he said. He said that the partnership between IIM Indore and the Indore Police has already proven successful, noting the city’s high recovery rate for missing minors. The aim of the KHOJ workshop, he said, was to continue building on that success by empowering IOs with the knowledge and techniques needed to prevent disappearances and ensure timely recovery. The workshop shared critical insights from IIM Indore’s research, including statistical data and case studies that shed light on the common causes and consequences of such disappearances. The training also aimed at inspiring IOs with success stories and providing strategies that have led to the safe recovery of minors in similar cases. The goal is to foster a positive outlook and resilience among the officers as they navigate these challenging investigations. Training officers on community engagement and communication techniques to build stronger relationships with local communities, schools, and organizations is also a part of the training. Furthermore, it included a focus on the legal rights of minors, the rights of their families, and the proper protocols for reporting and investigating such cases. The workshop provided the officers with hands-on learning opportunities through detailed case studies. These case studies, developed by IIM Indore, are based on real-life incidents and are designed to help officers understand the psycho-social triggers behind missing cases. Officers were trained in using these case studies to analyze the psychological state of both the victims and the accused, as well as to better engage with the victims’ families. “The goal behind the KHOJ workshop is to create awareness of the fact that missing minors are not just a legal issue but also a social and psychological one”, said Prof. Rai. We aim to help the officers become better equipped to approach each case with a deep understanding of family dynamics, peer pressure, and societal factors that often lead to such disappearances. This training will significantly improve how these cases are handled moving forward, he said. At IIM Indore, we believe in extending the boundaries of knowledge beyond classrooms. Through initiatives like KHOJ, IIM Indore is demonstrating its strong commitment to using academic insights to solve societal challenges. The institute’s collaboration with the Indore Police Commissionerate highlights the critical role that academic institutions can play in addressing pressing social issues. Previous Next"

The event was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director of IIM Indore, who underscored the importance of the Hindi language in today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape. Speaking about the vital role of languages in shaping a nation’s culture and identity, Prof. Rai highlighted the need to understand the profound connection between language, culture, and civilization. He stressed that just as Sanskriti (culture) and Sabhyata (civilization) are nurtured by language, Hindi, as a language, too, plays a pivotal role in preserving and propagating our rich cultural heritage. He explained that the cornerstone of our culture lies in our languages, with Hindi being one of the main languages that holds this cultural heritage. Prof. Rai highlighted that today’s youth often possess individual morals but lack a collective social moral compass. He stressed the importance of providing direction to these morals and values through Hindi, which serves as a medium for guiding society and preserving our cultural roots. He spoke about the uniqueness of Hindi, pointing out that it is written exactly as it is spoken, and that it has absorbed words and influences from many other languages, making it a rich and adaptable medium. He praised Hindi for its ability to guide people, offering clarity and wisdom. Prof. Rai underlined the need to guide society, culture, and the nation itself by incorporating the knowledge found in Indian languages into our lives. He urged everyone, even those unfamiliar with Hindi, to make an effort to speak and preserve it, along with all Indian languages. He explained that speaking these languages helps to connect people and maintain unity, emphasizing that Indian languages are essential for keeping the nation united. “Treat your language with the same respect and care as your mother, as it nourishes and shapes your identity just like a mother nurtures her child”, he said. This year’s celebration featured an engaging panel discussion titled “Digital Age of Media and Hindi Journalism.” The discussion was enriched by the insights of distinguished panelists including Mr. Brajesh Kumar Singh, Group Editor – Integration & Convergence at Network 18; Mr. Prabhash Jha, Editor of Indian Languages at Hindustan Times Digital; Mr. Panini Anand, Group Editor – TV9 Digital at TV9 Bharatvarsh; and Mr. Rajesh Upadhyay, Editor-in-Chief & Executive President of Jagran New Media. The session was expertly moderated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, who facilitated a deep dive into how Hindi journalism is adapting to and thriving in the digital age. Mr. Brajesh Kumar Singh emphasized the role of Hindi writers in preserving and promoting the language. He highlighted that Hindi authors not only gave new direction to literature but also played a significant role in shaping the language itself. He observed that the language of literature differs from the colloquial Hindi we see in films, which has evolved over time. “The increasing use of Hindi in the digital sphere won’t eclipse other Indian languages; rather, it will encourage their growth”, he said. As India approaches the threshold of overtaking China in terms of internet users, the digital expansion is set to boost the use of Hindi, alongside other regional languages, he added. Mr. Panini Anand, reflected on the deep historical connection between Hindi journalism and literature, remarking that “Sahitya (literature) is the birthplace of journalism.” He explained that journalism emerged from the rich tradition of literature and that, historically, Hindi journalism carried the essence of literature. However, he noted that today’s journalism lacks the literary depth it once had. “The digital boom, especially accelerated by the pandemic, has transformed the landscape of language consumption”, he said. While the language of journalism has changed over the years, the demand for content in diverse languages will only increase, indicating a more linguistically diverse future, he said. Mr. Prabhash Jha shed light on the importance of clarity in communication and the need for Hindi journalism to retain its connection with literature. He pointed out that the earlier era of journalism was deeply influenced by Hindi writers and thinkers. According to him, literature forms the foundation of language and communication, and it is crucial that Hindi journalism continues to evolve in a way that makes it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the language. “Language is constantly influenced by cultural shifts, including travel and migration, which impact vocabulary and pronunciation”, he said. Digital media may not change the essence of the language, but it does influence how it is consumed and adapted, he mentioned. Mr. Rajesh Upadhyay focused on the transformative power of digital journalism, calling it the future. He described language as both a science and an art, with writing being an art and understanding it as a science. Despite the rise of digital platforms, he pointed out that many still consume information in Hindi, and its relevance remains intact. While digital journalism has introduced significant changes in the way content is delivered, the foundation of strong journalism, he argued, is still rooted in literature. He also emphasized that while profits in Hindi journalism may fluctuate, the increasing literacy rates ensure its continuous relevance. The panel collectively agreed that while the digital age presents challenges, it also provides opportunities to expand the reach of Hindi, ensuring its role as a vital force in shaping India’s future cultural and linguistic landscape. In addition to the panel discussion, the celebration included the launch of the Annual Hindi Magazine “Gyaan Shikhar,” featuring insightful contributions from the IIM Indore community. Winners of the Antakshari competition conducted during the Hindi Fortnight were awarded, adding a competitive and festive spirit to the occasion. The successful celebration of Hindi Diwas and the associated activities underscore IIM Indore’s dedication to preserving and promoting Hindi and our Indian languages. Previous Next"

The institute is placed 3rd among the IIMs. On a global scale, the programme is placed in the 181+ bracket. IIM Indore’s Director, Prof. Himanshu Rai, expressed his delight at this significant achievement. “We are incredibly proud to have our PGPMX programme recognized in the QS Executive MBA Rankings. This ranking reflects the hard work and dedication of our faculty and participants. Our programme has been consistently gaining popularity among working executives, providing them with the tools and knowledge to excel in their careers. We are committed to continuous improvement and aim to be among the top 10 EMBA programmes in  the coming years.” The QS EMBA Rankings evaluate programmes based on several critical indicators: Employer Reputation, Thought Leadership, Executive Profile, Career Outcomes, and Diversity. In 2024, business schools from 48 locations were assessed globally, underscoring the competitive nature of these rankings. The methodology behind the rankings includes several key components. Career outcomes are measured by the average salary increase from pre to post-programme and the percentage of the class receiving promotions within 12 months of graduation. Diversity is evaluated by student gender and nationality diversity within the programme. Employer reputation is derived from the annual QS Employer Reputation survey, which assesses global employers’ perceptions of which institutions produce the most job-ready graduates. The executive profile is calculated by examining the average years of overall work experience, average years of managerial-level experience, and the percentage of the class with c-suite experience. Thought leadership is measured through the annual QS Academic Reputation survey, which evaluates the perceptions of global academics on which institutions demonstrate academic excellence. IIM Indore’s PGPMX stands out for its rigorous curriculum, which integrates seasoned professionals from various industries, functions, and regions. It is uniquely designed for working executives and entrepreneurs who aspire to become transformational leaders without compromising their professional commitments. The two-year, alternate weekend format offers flexibility, while the rigorous curriculum, delivered by distinguished faculty, ensures a high-quality learning experience. “Participants benefit from experiential learning, an international immersion programme, and networking opportunities with peers from diverse industries”, says Prof. Rai. We ensure that the programme’s integrated approach combines academic rigor with practical applications – and that makes it a powerful catalyst for career and personal growth, equipping executives to lead and innovate in a dynamic business environment. This recognition by QS is a reflection of the quality and impact of IIM Indore’s courses, which are designed to meet the evolving needs of working executives, he added. PGPMX has garnered significant interest and participation from a diverse array of industries, reflecting its appeal to working executives across multiple domains. Executives from banking, consultancy, engineering and technology, financial services, IT, manufacturing, marketing services, real estate, retail, and more find the programme uniquely tailored to their professional growth needs. This diversity not only enriches the classroom experience but also offers a dynamic learning environment where participants from different sectors exchange insights, collaborate on projects, and leverage their varied expertise to drive innovation and leadership excellence.

This year’s PIR evaluated the societal contributions of business schools from 30 countries. The ratings were announced by Prof. Thomas Dyllick, PIR Supervisory Board, Positive Impact Rating Association, and Carolin Lemke of Oikos International on June 18, 2024. IIM Indore’s Director, Prof. Himanshu Rai, highlighted the significance of this achievement: “Reaching Level 5 in the Positive Impact Rating reflects our relentless pursuit of excellence in developing a culture of sustainability and positive societal impact.

Prof. Thomas Dyllick, PIR Founder & Member of the Supervisory Board, said: “While future students now have an alternative source to select their business school, schools refer to the PIR primarily to measure and communicate their transformational progress. The voice of the student has become a true source of value.” In an email received by IIM Indore, PIR congratulated the institute on being rated as a Level 5 Pioneering School.  “Your school has been rated as a Level 5 Pioneering School. Level 5 is defined as “Showing unique, sustainable leadership in all impact dimensions” and contains schools scoring between 8.8 and 10 overall,” states the email. The scoring is based on the assessment of the seven key impact dimensions evaluated by PIR, which are Governance, Culture, Programs, Learning Methods, Student Support, Institution as a Role Model, and Public Engagement. “We look forward to your continued involvement in the PIR movement”, the email added. The rating survey included questions in these seven relevant impact dimensions that sit within three areas: Energizing, Educating, and Engaging. IIM Indore has secured a rating of 8.8, 8.7, and 8.9 out of 10 for Energizing, Educating, and Engaging Scores, respectively. The overall PIR score of the business school is used to position the schools across five levels. The different levels refer to the developmental stage of the business school, rating it by a certain level of achievement. PIR categorizes business schools into five levels, reflecting their progress in societal and environmental impact. “Beginning” schools are in the early stages of recognizing their role and face challenges in launching initiatives. “Emerging” schools start translating their commitment into action with initial successes. “Progressing” schools show significant improvements and results in certain impact areas. “Transforming” schools have integrated a strong culture of positive impact, demonstrating substantial and visible progress across multiple dimensions. Finally, “Pioneering” schools, which include IIM Indore, exhibit exceptional leadership and excellence in all areas of impact, serving as inspirational models for others. This system encourages continuous growth and innovation towards sustainable development. The PIR was created by business school experts together with global NGOs – WWF, Oxfam, and UN Global Compact.

This expansion will not only enhance our academic offerings but also significantly contribute to the holistic development of our students and faculty.” This project is a commitment to sustainable development and moving towards a net-zero campus. By integrating advanced environmental technologies such as solar power systems and solar water heating, the project aims to minimize reliance on non-renewable energy sources, significantly reducing the campus’s carbon footprint. The introduction of a state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant will allow for the recycling of wastewater, reducing water consumption and preventing environmental contamination. Additionally, the comprehensive landscaping plans include the use of native plant species and the development of green spaces that enhance biodiversity while providing ecological benefits like natural cooling and air purification. “These initiatives reflect our dedication to creating an eco-friendly learning environment that aligns with global sustainability standards and helps prepare students to be conscientious future leaders”, added Prof. Rai.

Mr. Makarand Deouskar expressed profound gratitude towards IIM Indore for their invaluable collaboration in addressing the critical issue of missing minors. ‘The research by IIM Indore has proved instrumental in understanding the complexities surrounding missing minors and devising effective preventive measures’, he said. These recommendations will enable us to develop an efficient and robust framework to enhance the social and institutional systems in place.’ The research embarked on a comprehensive exploration in three distinct phases. The archival analysis spanning the past five years laid the groundwork, followed by a diagnostic analysis delving deep into 70+ case studies, semi-structured interviews with police officers, and in-depth victim studies. The findings that emerged from this rigorous investigation illuminated the grim reality of missing minor cases, particularly spotlighting the plight of adolescent girls aged 13-17 from marginalized socio-economic backgrounds. IIM Indore team crafted a set of transformative recommendations aimed at protecting adolescents in Indore. For the Indore Police, the team has advocated for the establishment of a central communication channel and transport facility to expedite the recovery process, emphasizing the importance of a coordinated approach at the district or state level. ‘Implementation of a reward-based incentive system to recognize and motivate investigating officers, particularly those who successfully recover a significant number of missing children within a specified time-frame could also be encouraging’, said Prof. Rai. Moreover, specialized teams for the prevention and policing of crimes against minors were proposed to enhance the efficacy of law enforcement efforts in safeguarding vulnerable individuals. To generate awareness and promote proactive measures, the IIM Indore team has recommended various strategies under the Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) initiative. This includes the development of case studies with teaching notes to highlight psycho-social triggers and their impact, facilitating reflective discussions among potential victims, accused individuals, and their families. ‘Targeting risk-prone locations for intensive IEC training campaigns, leveraging social media platforms for short video awareness campaigns, and installing visually appealing messages with action-oriented taglines in urban slum areas and prone locations to raise awareness about the consequences of minors’ disappearance and the importance of prompt reporting to the authorities is also recommended’, said Prof. Rai. In terms of rehabilitation efforts, the IIM Indore team has emphasized the critical role of parenting and mentoring in the well-being of adolescents aged 13-17. Recommendations include the initiation of family counseling cells through the collaboration of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) catering to the lower socio-economic strata. IIM Indore is committed to societal welfare, and with this report, the institute emerges as a formidable force in the mission to protect and empower adolescents, paving the way for a brighter and safer future for generations to come.

He emphasized the pivotal role of the youth in realizing this vision and highlighted the immense potential of academic institutions, particularly IIM Indore, in contributing to this noble cause. “We at IIM Indore have adopted the principles of “Amrit Kaal” by addressing five critical issues: income and gender inequality, challenges in urban and rural areas, environmental conservation, and fostering entrepreneurial spirit among the youth”, he said. He emphasized on the institute’s collaboration with districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to promote local products under the ‘One District One Product’ initiative that is contributing to reducing income inequality. He also highlighted the efforts in improving traffic management in Indore have enhanced the quality of life for residents. “With a commitment to environment and sustainability, our Centre of Excellence, ANVESHAN, will be training 4,800 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) across the nation, inspiring young minds to establish startups in sanitation and cleanliness”, he added. Mentioning that in line with the Paanch Prans of the Amri Kaal, the institute is also taking initiatives to bridging the gap between rural and urban India through its Rural Engagement Programme. This programme allows students to immerse themselves in rural life, identify pressing issues, and devise practical solutions. The institute will also be offering specialized programme for women for career re-entry and will introduce a management development programme in Hindi, breaking boundaries and emphasizing that a unified workforce, regardless of gender or background, is the cornerstone of India’s prosperity. He mentioned that there is still much work to be done, and in a nation of 1.4 billion, the power to drive change lies within the unity of its people Ms. Anjana Om Kashyap began her address by planting a seed of thought that made the crowd wonder about India’s progress over the years, how we still have a long way to go, and how the citizens should give back to their country. What followed was her insights on the five main mantras, the ‘Amrit Paans’ of what Amrit Kaal truly means and what we as citizens can do to achieve that goal. The most pivotal and crucial step towards achieving Amrit Kaal starts with gender equality. Ms. Kashyap addressed how our country has progressed to a great extent in this sphere and yet there is a long way to go. “It is extremely important for women to fight to speak out their thoughts bravely and believe that their dreams and aspirations are second to none. It is high time that women break these shackles and society and today’s youth help and support them in doing so”, she said. She further discussed the importance of achieving a joyous balance between nationalism, national pride, and critique. It is important to look at the world from varied perspectives and develop a positive and responsible society. “What is equally important for us as citizens is to never forget our roots and respect our culture”, she said. Her emphasis on reaching out to rural areas and volunteering to improve the healthcare and education system was indeed inspirational. She also highlighted the unique and powerful position that India as a country has in the global setting. She concluded by emphasizing the responsibility of the youth to carry the nation towards its Amri Kaal. “It begins at home and it is the duty of every citizen to contribute towards making their country achieve great heights”, she said. An interactive Q&A session added to the enriching experience, with Ms. Kashyap addressing the youth’s questions, spanning topics from women empowerment and life lessons to challenges in media, social media, and entertainment. Her comprehensive responses left everyone inspired. The event concluded with a call for unity, social inclusion, diversity, and shared responsibility. The “India at 2047: Amrit Kaal” event marked an essential step towards realizing this vision, with attendees inspired by the commitment and dedication of IIM Indore to shape the future of the nation.

The workshops were inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director of IIM Indore, on September 19, 2023. This marks the institute’s second endeavor in organizing a six-month Sanskrit Workshop due to the overwhelming enthusiasm displayed by the IIM Indore community during the previous edition. As part of its steadfast commitment to cultural preservation and nation-building, IIM Indore has taken a significant step by introducing the Odia language workshop alongside Sanskrit. A remarkable total of 98 community members have registered for these transformative workshops. In his address, Prof. Himanshu Rai reaffirmed the institute’s dedication to fostering a deeper connection with our linguistic and cultural heritage. He underscored the importance of these workshops in preserving India’s rich linguistic diversity and contributing to the nation’s growth. Prof. Rai expressed his pride in the IIM Indore community’s keen interest in language learning and commended their commitment to embracing Sanskrit and Odia. “These workshops not only provide a platform for language acquisition but also serve as a bridge to our roots and traditions”, he said. Sanskrit, often regarded as the “Language of the Gods,” continues to draw significant attention for its cultural and historical significance. It is a vibrant language with multiple applications, including artistic expression and everyday communication, said Prof. Rai. He also highlighted the importance of Odia in the context of Odisha’s rich cultural tapestry. He noted that Odia, like Sanskrit, is deeply embedded in the region’s values, knowledge, and traditions. Prof. Rai expressed optimism about the impact these workshops will have on preserving and promoting these languages. “Languages aren’t just a means of communication but as the essence of one’s identity. He likened languages to nurturing mothers, shaping individuals into who they are today”, he said. He stated, “Our existence owes a debt to the languages we speak and embrace. Preserving and promoting the diverse regional languages of India is our duty.” Mr. Pravesh Vaishnav emphasized that Sanskrit, often perceived as a challenging language, is, in fact, as accessible as any other. He drew a beautiful parallel, likening the process of learning Sanskrit to how a mother communicates with her newborn and toddler. He explained, “You listen, you learn. Just as a mother speaks to her child, Sanskrit can be learned through listening and speaking. Children start by speaking, then gradually learn to read, followed by writing, and eventually delve into the intricacies of grammar. The journey with Sanskrit can be just as natural and enjoyable.” He pointed out that while individuals are often identified by their regional languages, such as Marathi-speaking or Gujarati-speaking, there is a larger vision of unity for the nation. “To truly unite our nation, we should all embrace Sanskrit. Instead of being known by our regional identities, we could be called ‘Bharateeya,’ representing the amalgamation of our diverse cultures and languages”, he said. Mr. Jagadish Mishra, Odia Tutor, took everyone on a captivating journey through Odisha’s illustrious history, firmly rooted in the globally celebrated “Rathayatra” festival. With pride, he highlighted Odisha’s remarkable achievements and the esteemed personalities hailing from the state, ranging from President Srimati Draupadi Murmu to sports champions and cultural luminaries like Padmashree Prafulla Kar. He delved into the profound impact of the Kalinga War on Ashoka, a pivotal moment that transformed him into a spiritual leader. Mr. Mishra also meticulously traced the evolution of the Odia language, paying homage to visionary figures such as Adikabi Sarala Das, Kabisamrat Upendra Bhanja, and Byasakabi Fakir Mohan Senapati. He expressed deep gratitude for the Government of India’s recognition of Odia as a classical language. He passionately encouraged the community to embrace the rich beauty of Odia and actively participate in the Odia Learning Initiative, all while expressing heartfelt appreciation for the institute’s unwavering commitment to nurturing regional languages. As he aptly put it, “Our languages are the vibrant threads of our cultural tapestry, each one contributing to the rich mosaic of our heritage.” Reflecting on the success of the previous Sanskrit and Tamil language workshops, Prof. Rai extended his heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated language instructors, Shri Pravesh Vaishnav and Sushri Lakshmi Gopalakrishnan, for not only imparting linguistic knowledge but also fostering curiosity and respect for these languages within the IIM Indore community. The workshops aim to provide a nurturing environment for the IIM Indore community to learn, appreciate, and excel in Sanskrit and Odia, fostering a stronger bond with their linguistic heritage. The event witnessed an overwhelming response from community members, united in their commitment to linguistic exploration and cultural preservation. Previous Next"

Many believed that the nation would not remain unified due to its multiple nations, diverse cultures, and numerous languages. However, Prof. Pradhan underscored, that there is an intrinsic quality within India that defies division. Prof. Pradhan highlighted the symbiotic relationship between languages, emphasizing that they learn from each other. He celebrated the role of vernacular languages, especially Marathi, in enriching Hindi. Our Hindi language is like a flowing river, and the new words from different languages are like fresh tributaries, enriching the language’s vocabulary, he said. He also stressed that Hindi, with its growing technical and managerial lexicon, is poised to thrive in the modern world, becoming richer and more vibrant. He emphasized that print journalism has been instrumental in bridging the geographical, cultural, and linguistic gaps across the nation. He concluded by asserting that India’s greatness lies in its unity, shared values, morals, culture, and a deep sense of patriotism and nationalism that transcends languages and boundaries. The highlight of the celebration was the release of the Annual Hindi Magazine of the institute, “Gyaan Shikhar.” This magazine features insightful articles contributed by the members of the IIM Indore community. The Hindi Pakhwada at IIM Indore embraced the spirit of competition. The event featured two exciting competitions, “Picture Story Writing” and “Antakshari,” in which all members participated with immense enthusiasm. The winners of these competitions received their prizes, adding a competitive edge to the celebrations. In addition to the festivities, the event also marked the conclusion of Swachhata Pakhwada, a cleanliness drive that was concurrently organized at the institute. The entire IIMI community joined hands to volunteer for a massive campus clean-up, emphasizing the institution’s commitment to cleanliness and hygiene. The successful culmination of Hindi Diwas and the associated competitions, along with the dedication displayed during Swachhata Pakhwada, reflect IIM Indore’s commitment to both linguistic and environmental responsibilities.

Ms. Rishu Garg quoted examples from the agriculture industry, and how technology has revolutionized the industry to predict and increase farmers’ yields.

Leaders need to adopt technology to assist in augmenting skills”, she said. Mr. Das spoke about the fact that the law landscape has changed with the advent of technology, making its arguments stronger, saving time and increasing efficiency, thereby reducing the time to review legal contracts or translate them into other languages. Predictive analysis helps to make the legal industry data-driven using AI as an enabler. “Bots can’t replace the touchpoints with the employees as human interaction is critical.

The first event witnessed the entire IIM Indore community coming together for an enriching Yoga Session. Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, inaugurated the event. He emphasized the significance of yoga, stating that skillfully performing any task is yoga, transforming individuals into yogis. He highlighted the comprehensive nature of Ashtanga Yoga , which encompasses not only asanas and pranayama but also Yama (ethical principles), Niyama (personal observances), and the subsequent stages of pratyahara (withdrawal of senses), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation), and samadhi (state of bliss). Prof. Rai also emphasized the five principles of Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Aparigraha (non-possessiveness), and Brahmacharya (conservation of energy) as integral aspects of yoga. Furthermore, Prof. Rai elucidated the five rules of yoga, namely Shoucha (physical and spiritual cleanliness), Santosha (contentment), Tapa (discipline and perseverance), Swadhyaya (self-learning), and Ishvara Pranidhana (surrendering to the cosmic consciousness). He encouraged individuals to identify their connection with the universe, highlighting that comprehending relationships with parents, siblings, and colleagues is essential, and similarly, understanding the holistic bond with the air, water, land, and environment is crucial to discovering the purpose of life.

IIM Indore has solidified its position as a business school that generates a significant positive impact on culture, governance, and systems at a global scale. The prestigious Positive Impact Rating 2023 by the UN PRME Global Forum has acknowledged and listed the institute in the esteemed Level 4 category. On June 14, 2023, Prof. Thomas Dyllick of the Positive Impact Rating Association and Lauriane Dietrichs, Vice-President of Oikos International, jointly made the announcement. Notably, in the fourth edition of the rating, IIM Indore secured a sport in the Level 4 category. This recognition highlights the institute’s outstanding commitment to making a positive societal impact. A picture from our Spiritual Garden, representing our initiative of geo-tagging the plants on our campus, allowing us to digitally track and monitor their growth and well-being. This, along with our many green initiatives, are a testament to our dedication to environmental sustainability. Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director of IIM Indore, expressed his delight over the Level 4 PIR rating, stating, “We are delighted to be listed among the Level 4 PIR Ratings. This serves as an empowering force, inspiring us to strive for excellence in our endeavors. By recognizing and promoting positive societal impact, this rating system encourages us to actively contribute towards a better world”, he said. At IIM Indore, we focus on taking all the initiatives that contribute to the well-being of the student, society, nation, and world as a whole. This motivates us to embrace more responsible practices, expand our innovative solutions, and multifold our sustainable approaches, ensuring that our actions align with the greater goal of creating a positive and inclusive future. “Apart from various sustainable practices and green initiatives on campus, we also focus on providing grassroots opportunities for our students to understand the significance of creating a positive impact through our Rural Engagement Programme (REP). Our students get a chance to stay in the villages of Madhya Pradesh state, thereby identifying and understanding the problems faced by rural India, thereby making our curriculum relevant and encouraging the students to come up with innovative solutions”, he said. The Himalayan Outbound Programme helps our students get exposure to extreme situations enhancing their leadership, decision-making, and team spirit, and events like Utsaha help them learn about grassroots marketing. “Our institute is a no-single-use-plastic zone, we plant more than 2.5 thousand trees annually, have an efficient rainwater harvesting system, and a waste management system that treats thousands of kilos of waste daily. Our students also play a significant role in enhancing our sustainable activities”, he added.PIR appears at a time when societal impact and purpose have become the new focus not only for business but also for business schools. This reflects in many developments in education, research, school governance, and management. Most importantly, EQUIS and AACSB, the two leading international business school accreditation systems, have recently integrated societal impact and sustainability into their respective demands for accrediting business schools.Triple Crown accredited IIM Indore also received various awards related to its green practices. The institute received Silver at the Business Education Awards for Best Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative for ESG Activities in 2022. Recently, the institute also shone in the Membership Spotlight at the 2023 EFMD Annual Conference for its commitment to a green and sustainable campus.“We have an organic garden that produces tonnes of chemical-free veggies and fruits, and our horticulture cell, Sanjeevani, cultivates medicinal herbs that are distributed free of cost. With so many ongoing initiatives, and many in the pipeline, we are determined to continue to create a positive impact and look forward to being included in the Level 5 Pioneering institutions in the coming years”, said Prof. Rai. The Positive Impact Rating (PIR) introduces a comprehensive classification system with five distinct levels, each representing different stages of schools’ progress and impact dimensions. At the “Beginning” level, schools are at the initial phase, either considering or facing challenges in launching their positive impact initiatives. As schools transition to the “Emerging” level, they begin translating their commitment into action, making tangible strides in one or more impact domains. “Progressing” schools showcase evidence of results across select impact dimensions, signifying their advancing journey towards positive impact. The “Transforming” level signifies schools with a thriving positive impact culture, deeply ingrained in their governance and systems, resulting in visible outcomes and remarkable progress across multiple impact dimensions. Finally, the “Pioneering” level highlights schools that exemplify outstanding global leadership, consistently excelling in all impact dimensions, and serving as beacons of inspiration for others. This nuanced framework allows for a comprehensive assessment of schools’ positive impact journeys while encouraging continuous growth and innovation in creating a better future. PIR recognizes that business schools play a crucial role in fostering positive societal impact, going beyond economic contributions. Students assess institutions based on energizing dimensions such as governance and culture. Educating dimensions include programs, learning methods, and student support. Engaging dimensions involve the institution as a role model and public engagement. These assessments shape future leaders committed to positive societal impact. “One of the most promising insights from the PIR is that schools from developing economies are performing significantly better than schools from developed economies. It is promising, as this result might strengthen the discussion on Business Schools in the Global South and their contribution to Sustainable Development.”, said Urs Jäger, Prof. at INCAE Business School, Costa Rica, Executive Director, Viva Idea, and Member of the PIR Advisory Board. The data collection was organized by student associations, which distributed surveys across campuses. The PIR gives the students a platform to assess the positive impact of their schools, providing a unique opportunity for their voices to be heard. With an unwavering determination, IIM Indore eagerly anticipates future progress and aspires to be recognized as a Level 5 pioneering institution, continuing to create a lasting positive impact.

We are 1.4 billion Indians, and together we all can make a difference. It’s time to identify problems and look for solutions to make a difference to this nation and the world as a whole,” he said. Prof. Shruti Tewari encouraged the batch to be open to experience and explore the realities during their internships. “Try to come out of your comfort zone and be purpose-oriented. This social internship is going to help you identify your purpose in life, what you are passionate about, and help bring about change in your life and society,” she said. Launched in 2011, the IPM programme is a unique innovation of IIM Indore, aimed at producing socially conscious and contextually relevant managers. The social placement programme serves the dual purpose of providing students with professional working experience in a social backdrop while allowing them to apply their interdisciplinary learnings in solving real-life social problems in association with other organizations. The programme is initiated by the students and executed by an elected student body called the Social Placement Committee. With 100% placements, the batch has secured a total of 127 offers for 122 students who opted for the campus placement process. Of these, 72% of the total offers are from CSR sectors, while 22% of the total offers came from social impact organizations, marking the first time such organizations have participated in the programme. Social incubators were the third most popular sector, followed by research institutes & think tanks, and NGOs. The majority of the roles offered were in research & insights, data analysis, corporate communications, marketing, and field research. However, this year also saw an increase in roles offered in the domains of finance & investment and impact measurement, broadening the scope of exposure for the students. This year, a total of 33 recruiting organizations participated in the programme, with 52% being first-time recruiters. Prominent CSR recruiters included Capgemini, TCS, JM Financial, Tata, Biocon, among others. The prominent social incubators that participated were CIIE.CO from IIM Ahmedabad, NSRCEL from IIM Bangalore, and Viilgro Innovations Foundation.

As a kick-off event, the institute is celebrating the 300 th birth year of Adam Smith, the Father of Economics, with its international partner, the University of Glasgow. The institute had signed an MoU with the University of Glasgow, the fourth oldest university in the UK, in August 2022 to offer various joint programmes and dual degree programmes, and is now collaborating on multiple fronts. The series was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. The series witnessed Dr. V Anantha Nageswaran, the Chief Economic Advisor of the Government of India, interacting with the community online. The scintillating galaxy of speakers included Dr. John Finch, Professor of Marketing and Head – Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow; Prof. Alex Thomas, School of Arts and Science, Azim Premji University; and Prof. Subhasankar Chattopadhyay, IIM Indore. In his inaugural address, Prof. Himanshu Rai mentioned the five-point agenda, the ‘Panchamrit’, presented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the National Statement at the COP26 Summit held at Glasgow. He mentioned that similar to the Panchamrit pledge, IIM Indore had identified five areas of its contribution to Nation Building in 2019, and had determined to resolve the challenges in these areas. “We aim to create, curate, practice, and disseminate knowledge that solves real-world problems. These include income inequality, rural issues, urban management problems, environmental and sustainability challenges, and need for fostering entrepreneurship culture.” ‘Globalization has led to an increase in income inequality, and thus, IIM Indore is helping the state government in its One District One Product programme to boost vocal for local. He said we also conduct various financial literacy workshops for women. Sharing that the Rural Engagement Programme of IIM Indore gives the students a platform to live in the villages, understand the challenges of the rural residents, and find solutions to their problems, which then enables students to learn from grassroot experiences. This is important, as nearly 833 million people in India live in the rural areas, and we need to address their problems which are much different than in urban areas’, he said. Regarding the traffic management problems in the urban areas, Prof. Rai mentioned that IIM Indore has also submitted a report to the Madhya Pradesh Government to help them revamp the traffic management system and work on ways to reduce the number of road accidents. ‘IIM Indore is also establishing a Centre of Excellence focusing on WASH – Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene, and will train 4800 ULBs across the nation, in association with its international partners, to strengthen the system. He said that one of our partner universities in this initiative is the University of Glasgow. He added that the Centre of Excellence would also incubate the startups focusing on WASH. Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran spoke about the relevance of Adam Smith in today’s world. He noted that while the economies would never entirely rely on market forces wherein there’s perfect competition or a balance between producers and sellers ‘To that extent, Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand fulfills the conditions of being a perfect economic theory that helps in analyzing the real world or a cherished goal that may be practically attainable’. He said there might be politics without economics, but there’s no economics without politics. ‘Economics cannot be taken out of its context. It differs from physical science in that respect. Laws of science are immutable, but economic theories are a function of the context in which they operate – and this is why Adam Smith’s theories are relevant even today’, he remarked. Dr. John Finch, speaking about ‘Adam Smith’s Agencies and Soft Powers’, shared how Smith’s efficiency in making a difference, making decisions, and thought processes and actions are powers that look remarkably soft. Smith’s exciting views on education, state-funded education, and fee-paying vocational education to shape the curricula have also transformed the modern education system. ‘As a citizen, Smith went beyond the education sector and contributed to several social reforms, including the division of labour. He remains an inspiration for us all, even today’, he said. Prof. Alex Thomas discussed about Adam Smith and Classical Political Economy. He said that Adam Smith’s concepts are usually misinterpreted today; thus, it is essential to understand the context in which Smith wrote his concepts. For this, it is imperative to pay attention to the intellectual landscape of economics today, which is predominantly understood as a supply and demand approach only. He mentioned that Smith believed education has to be publicly supported and that it is the key to moral and social benefits. ‘Smith emphasized that education enables a person to gain wisdom, understand moral sentiments and help a person gain self-respect’, Prof. Thomas explained. Prof. Subhasankar Chattopadhyay talked about Smith’s Invisible Hand and the Price Theory. He discussed how the concept of the Invisible Hand emerged and how it promoted an end that was not intended. ‘It is crucial to resolve the tension between efficiency and equity. While efficiency focuses on no wastage, equity depends on the diversity of people who are intrinsically different and want to be different and is defined in terms of income, consumption, wealth, and opportunities’, he said. Dr. Xiang Li, Head of the Life-long Learning and International Development Office, also interacted with the IIM Indore community. She expressed her delight in visiting IIM Indore.

He also emphasized employees’ mental health and how HRs have a crucial role in framing corporate HR policies that can help maintain a work-life balance. ‘Corporates can achieve ESG goals by educating and making each employee aware of the larger picture and long-term impact of climate change’, he stated. The highlight of the first day was a series of Keynote Addresses on different facets of the theme of the conclave. Mr. Sanjay Khare’s talk was preceded by a video, which sent a strong message to humanity about how we are orchestrating our extinction by incessantly relying on fossil fuels. Mr. Khare emphasized VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) and mentioned that we need to tailor our approach to solve the challenges in the present scenario. He suggested a three-point approach to achieve Net Zero – Avoiding CO2 emissions as much as possible, switching to renewable energy resources, and compensating for residual emissions by other activities. He advised everyone to plant at least 14 plants in their lifetime. ‘Innovate, take charge and become the pioneers of climate innovations, driving change’, he said. Mr. Sarvana Sastha Kumar, Senior Director at Tiger Analytics, spoke about the importance of analytics in today’s world. He iterated how, in the 90s, with limited data, life was quite simple. However, computational power was expensive. But now data is available everywhere, and today’s computers have enormous power. But now, an essential part is to ask the right question. The field of analytics is growing at an unprecedented level. Specifically, forecasting has improved vastly in the supply chain field. He said there is a shortage of competent data analytics professionals today. He also mentioned how companies today are focusing on building smart operations. ‘With the customer now at the center of everything, it is becoming imperative for companies to get data and deliver what the customer wants’, he said.

Prof. S K Ghosh, Faculty, IIM Indore, moderated the session. Mr. Shashi Bhatia stressed the importance of upskilling in digital and cognitive abilities. He also discussed effective work-life balance and developing a just workplace culture. ‘We need a lot of help understanding how managers handle hybrid work setup. If you have a part of your organization that works in the physical setup while another part works in the virtual setup, you need skills and emotional intelligence to handle that. Therefore, a lot of focus should be on the managerial capability’, he said. Mr. Harshvardhan Kundalkar spoke about how humans strive for human contact and a social environment— that’s what makes us human and essential at the workplace. ‘I am concerned about the type of environment in which we will be living, which is extremely transactional, an environment we do not want to be in. Human beings strive for human contact in a social setting. I don’t want to sound philosophical, but that raises many questions about what kind of culture you want to create’, he said. Mr. Balaji Kumar discussed how the workforce is becoming dispersed due to the remote working culture. A performance management system that meets the organization’s objectives while also managing the dispersed workforce is required. ‘It’s just that we need to start over with some design thinking principles to redesign some of those elements’, he said. The panel discussion concluded with a Q&A session, wherein the panelists delightfully answered the queries of the participants attending the event. The conclave also witnessed a case study competition, wherein the participants presented their case solutions.

He said that one needs to develop fortitude in themselves, and practicing courage is the best way to do so. ‘Often people ask me how to be courageous. I advise them to practice courage. If you plan to do something, make sure you don’t let your fear defeat you’, he said.

He further motivated the participants to identify their passion, introspect and reflect on their life’s purpose. ‘Find out how you wish to define success, for success changes now and then.

Prof. Manoj Motiani, Programme Coordinator, GMPe and Faculty, IIM Indore, and Dr. Mahesh Chotrani, Founder Director, Anisuma Training Institute, were also present. In his commencement speech, Prof. Himanshu Rai spoke about the three blocks a person has to face in life, ways to overcome them, and the three changes that will help a person become happy, content, and successful in life. Talking about ‘Swadharma’, he said that once a person can discover his passion, that becomes their swadharma. Once you have identified your swadharma, he said you might have to overcome a triad of stumbling blocks to move forward with it. Mentioning these blocks, Prof. Rai said, ‘Realize that money is the first block, and you must decide what you wish to achieve with your wealth. Make sure you can differentiate between your needs and desires’. He urged the new batch to build a life on their expectations to eliminate the second block – negativity. Fear of failure, he said, is the third block. ‘Trailblaze your path. The key to success is having the ability to never give up, have the grit to keep going’, he explained. Prof. Rai advised the participants to build relationships and enhance their network, enabling them to become successful leaders. Talking about conscientiousness, Prof. Rai said that discipline, being open to experimentation, trying out new things, and having the curiosity to learn from everything help a person achieve their goals. He suggested that the participants practice the art of drawing their identity from their passion and not from the designation they hold in their organization. ‘Utilize your privileges for the ones who are in need. The proper use of your capability can help another person achieve happiness. If you can spread happiness and joy around yourself, you will reach your true potential and make this universe a better place to live in’, he said.

Launched in 2009 (as the Rural Immersion Programme), the REP aims to provide its participants with a rich, practical, and socially-oriented approach to learning. The programme aims to sensitize budding managers and entrepreneurs towards the various schemes undertaken by the government in villages and to study and analyze their execution and effectiveness. The programme was inaugurated by Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash, Dean (Programmes), IIM Indore. Shri Vivek Dave, Joint Commissioner, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Shri Anil Kochhar, Deputy Commissioner, Pradhan Mantri Pohan Shakti Nirman, Prof. Shrihari S. Sohani, PGP Chair, and Prof. Bhavani Shankar, REP Coordinator and Faculty, IIM Indore were also present. This year, the participants will study three schemes, namely, the SHGs : Social empowerment, addressing distress economic needs and livelihood enhancement possibilities , Impact assessment of Pushkar and Amrit schemes , and the PM Awas Yojana: Response to change in implementation strategy and success rate . During the inaugural, Prof. Dash, in his address, mentioned that this year, after a gap of two years, our participants are participating in the programme in an offline mode. He said that the REP is well-aligned with IIM Indore’s mission, to be a contextually relevant business school and help develop “socially conscious” managers, leaders and entrepreneurs. The shift from the observant approach in the Immersion Programme to the participative approach in the Engagement Program was emphasised. Prof. Dash also focused on the concept of “mindful learning” as a benefit of REP. He brought into perspective the importance of context-relevant ideas that one needs to work on when dealing with the complexities of life, be it in the corporate world or while dealing with the pressing concerns of rural India. The participants were advised to experience the rural way of life, expose themselves to the functionalities of the government, and apply the knowledge gained in real life. He also encouraged the participants to come up with advisories and make a significant and genuine contribution in the development. REP is an imperative programme since it aids the participants in understanding ground realities and enhances their social consciousness, sensitivity, and managerial and decision-making skills, he mentioned. Shri Vivek Dave sensitized the participants on the contextual differences between Urban and Rural India. He elaborated on how the Rural Development Initiatives were broadly divided into four categories, namely, infrastructure development, natural resources management, livelihood promotion, and institutional setups. Shri Vivek talked about the agriculture-based economy and the large portion of the rural population engaged in the unorganized sector. He advised the participants to research the number of SHGs, their impact, engagement, and dynamics. Further, he urged them to study the outcome and accessibility of the other two schemes and how these translated into the ease of living, health and social status of the beneficiaries. Mr. Anil Kochar gave details about several government schemes and the current status of these in the rural context. He talked about the impact on individual, social and economic levels. He elaborated how PM Avaas Yojna instilled a sense of ownership among the beneficiaries, who became more conscious of their houses and used them in a befitting manner. His insights on the current performance of these schemes gave a sense of confidence to the taxpayer that his/her money was being well-utilized. Giving an introduction to the REP, Prof. Bhavani Shankar noted that IIM Indore had taken intense steps to increase the engagement of participants with a noble cause of making a difference in the lives of rural people. ‘The change in rural landscape is a daunting task; however, the participants will have a constructive engagement with the villagers during this week. He encouraged the students to utilize this time in the best way and hoped that they continue to bring accolades to the institute through REP. A total of 644 participants from the first year of PGP and PGPHRM and the fourth year of IPM will interact with 109 Gram Panchayats in 13 districts in Madhya Pradesh. These include Alirajpur, Barwani, Bhopal, Dewas, Dhar, Harda, Indore, Khandwa, Khargon, Ratlam, Sehore, Shajapur, and Ujjain. The entire week is characterized by visits to various blocks in the district, where participants critically analyze the execution plan of numerous government schemes and survey villages to observe the actual level of implementation. Through this process, they assess the challenges faced in executing the schemes while identifying operational gaps that could be bridged through better planning and management strategies. The participants will then submit a report of their analysis and make suitable recommendations that prove helpful. The participants would submit a report on the topic of the study, a 5-minute video on the village they studied, and a short report on their individual experiences while staying in the village.

The role of human resources has changed drastically over the last three years, leading to several challenges for human resource managers and organizers. In line with this, the Post Graduate Programme in Human Resource Management – PGPHRM Batch 2021-23 has again come up with its insightful HR Conclave – IIMINENCE 3.0. The theme for this year’s conclave is Brace/Embrace and will witness numerous guest lectures and competitions over a period of two months. The inauguration of the conclave took place on October 12, 2022. Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash, Dean – Programmes; Prof. Amitabh Deo Kodwani; and Prof. Jatin Pandey, Chair – PGPHRM, shared their views on this occasion. Prof. Ranjeet Nambudiri also addressed the gathering online. Prof. Abhishek Mishra, Chair – FPM, and Col. Gururaj Gopinath Pamidi (Retd), CAO, IIM Indore, were also present. Prof. Shruti Tewari, Chair – IPM, attended online. Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash mentioned that PGPHRM and IIMINENCE – both are in line with IIM Indore’s mission. ‘PGPHRM is specifically designed to nurture budding managers and help them upgrade skills, specifically in the human resource management domain. The post-pandemic work culture has changed drastically, and retaining and engaging employees is challenging. The challenges of HR are multidimensional, and it is imperative to gain competencies that help the HR managers balance their static knowledge and implement their ideas, plans, and strategies in the dynamic workplace culture, which includes offline hybrid and online mode’, he said. Prof. Amitabh Deo Kodwani shared his views about the emerging challenges in the last three years. ‘Earlier, the HR managers were responsible for retaining and engaging the employees. However, during the pandemic, they grappled with solutions to effective work-from-home and employee outputs. Today, in the post-pandemic world, HR managers have identified problems like great resignation, quiet quitting, and moonlighting’. He said that we have shifted from a reactive to a proactive approach in terms of Human Resource Management. He mentioned that with the emergence of quiet layoff and policy changes, a new set of challenges are bound to change the priorities of the HR managers. ‘Events like IIMINENCE provide a platform for the young minds to discover opportunities in this crisis and come up with innovative and substantial solutions’, he said. Prof. Ranjeet Nambudiri spoke on the conclave theme – Brace/Embrace. He noted that the current scenario offers the organization food for thought about whether we should continuously evolve or wait for the situation to stabilize. HR plays a vital role in this brainstorming. With the advancement in technology, data analytics, data science, and other innovations, it’s high time HR finds ways to put the ‘human’ back into the organization. ‘This doesn’t mean that performance or productivity should lose their importance; instead, attention should be brought to understanding the challenges of the employees at the workplace’, he said. With so many external shocks, organizations are now giving importance to their employees’ mental health and well-being. ‘When employees perceive the workplace environment to be supportive, it benefits their mental and physical health too’, he said. Rather than considering the employees as a contributor or a producer, it’s time that organizations help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and create solutions and opportunities to maximize their competencies and reduce their stress. The two-month-long festival would witness a variety of speakers from diverse backgrounds like – Talent Acquisition, HR Analytics, M&A, Performance Management, and Organization Development and Change. The event will also include workshops on current trends and new developments in the field of HR and Leadership. The conclave includes a series of case competitions, wherein 4 domain-focused cases will be followed by a case encompassing all aspects of HR and Business for the grand finale with a prize pool of Rs. 2,00,000/-.

The city has established a milestone in cleanliness and sanitation, and the planning and execution strategy implemented by the administration is commended across the globe. IIM Indore aims to be a contextually-relevant institute, determined to contribute to nation-building. This MoU focuses on establishing a Centre of Excellence that will design and implement training and development courses for the political leadership, including mayors and ward councilors, to build their capacities, skills, and sensitivity. This training would strengthen their abilities to drive the initiatives for urban sanitation and waste management’, he said. Besides training, the CoE will also offer full-time and part-time programmes relevant to public policy, urban governance, and change management for administrators, managerial and executive cadre, and front-line employees of corporations and local bodies. ‘Our CoE will serve as a bridge between municipal corporations and local bodies, businesses, and service organizations. We plan to establish an incubation center in partnership with IIT Indore, and also offer advisory services on the utilization of funds and support from the corporate partners to the ULBs for delivery of municipal and civic services’ he said. Ms. Roopa Mishra also expressed her delight over collaboration with IIM Indore. ‘IIM Indore is among the top business and management institutions in India and is the second IIM in the nation to receive three prestigious international accreditations. Situated in central India, the institute has played a significant role in developing the city and the state through various collaborations with the government and administrative bodies. The establishment of IIM Indore’s CoE is yet another initiative that reflects the dedication and determination of the institute to contribute to the nation’, she said. She noted that IIM Indore is known for its state-of-the-art infrastructure; thus, the CoE will be established in the IIM Indore campus with smart classrooms, offering world-class training. ‘The CoE will also conduct research in sanitation and waste management, and create a repository of the best practices in urban transformation’, she said.

The batch was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Lieutenant General K H Gawas, Commandant MCTE, MHOW, was the Chief Guest. Prof. Kousik Guhathakurta, Programme Coordinator, CCBMDO; Prof. Subin Sudhir, Chair – Executive Education; and Col. Gururaj Gopinath Pamidi (Retd), CAO, IIM Indore were also present. Prof. Himanshu Rai, in his address, spoke about ‘PEN’: identifying the ‘Purpose’, augmenting the ‘Emotional Quotient’ and ‘Networking’. Sharing personal experiences of his transitional journey from working in an industry and shifting to academia, he emphasized identifying the purpose of one’s life. ‘I figured out my purpose and decided that I wanted to be in academia. Despite what others said and warned me about not making this career change, I trusted my competencies, identified my goal, and chose academia as my life’s path, he said. You are now a part of a management programme, but you need to find out why you are here. Get a vision in your life and add a pinch of imagination to it. ‘Use this imagination to create the world you want to step into as corporates’, he said. Mentioning that the defense training prepares an individual in an emotionally stoic way. However, the world this batch will now step into has people who will challenge and compliment them at every step. ‘You are trained to accomplish a task and administer it. However, once you graduate, you may have room to make decisions before executing your plan. People may or may not implement what you order them. Thus, it’s time to transition from listening to responding to listening to understanding’, he explained. He encouraged the officers to interact, engage and network with people from diverse backgrounds. ‘This will enable you to build strong relationships and learn from and with each other, for everyone has something new to teach’, he said. Lt. General Gawas noted that this robustly designed course by IIM Indore will help the officers build their goal step by step and achieve their dreams. ‘What happens when somebody throws a stone at you?’, he questioned. He said that each one of us has a different reaction to the situations in our lives. ‘You could throw the stone back at the person, or you could dodge, or you could also collect all the stones and create a house out of it’, he said. He said that this programme would provide a platform for the defense officers to manage the stones in a way that helps them build their dreams. The course will augment the pre-existing skills you gained during your training and assist you in gaining a new perspective on life. ‘A ‘fauji’ is believed to be adept only at administration. However, CCBMDO aids you to explore new horizons and open doors for opportunities in operations, logistics, finance, entrepreneurship, etc.’, he said. ‘Discover yourself in this six-month journey with IIM Indore, let life unfold, and only then will you realize that this was a turning point in your life’, he concluded. Prof. Kousik Guhathakurta also welcomed the batch. He mentioned that this programme is an initiative by IIM Indore to serve the nation. ‘The last 18 batches are a testimony to the fact that this course has been immensely beneficial for the defense officers in a smooth transition from defense to the corporate’, he said. Prof. Subin Sudhir briefed the participants about the institute’s ranking and initiatives. He noted that CCBMDO, like all the other flagship programmes, focuses on participant-centric learning. ‘You will get an opportunity to learn beyond the classroom walls, indulge in group activities and discussions, prepare and learn from case studies and each other as well’, he said.

Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, inaugurated the event. Mr. N.K. Singh, Senior Journalist, and Founding Secretary General, Broadcaster Editors’ Association, was the Chief Guest on occasion. Prof. Himanshu Rai, in his address, spoke about the condition, direction, and vision of the Hindi language. Sharing insights about the difference between a country and a nation, he said that a country has a geographical land mass, people, and sovereignty. In contrast, the nation has a fourth element added to it –culture. This is the foundation on which we should generate a new, just, and vibrant world, and language is the underpinning for the culture. ‘It’s time we start focusing on the nation and pay attention to the state of the Hindi language. We have changed, and so has our culture. We, as human beings, have personal ethics and values, but we are oblivious to social ethics. Love and respect exist in society, but we hardly express them. We are ready to struggle and have the power to overcome challenges, but we don’t have a direction to find solutions. We don’t want to solve problems; we want to break everything against us. We must gain moral and social values. This is possible only when we stay connected to our roots, and Hindi plays a significant role in this’, he explained. He noted that all our epics are in Hindi and Sanskrit and echo the rich culture full of morals, principles, ethics, and values that hold our nation together. ‘Acknowledging the state of our Hindi language will enable us to use our power in the right direction, thereby giving our lives a purpose’, he said. Speaking about the significance of Hindi in educational institutions, he said that it’s essential to understand the difference between being literate and educated. ‘A person may not be literate and might not even know English, but he may be efficient in leadership, decision-making, risk management and even have a solution-oriented thought process, only if given a chance’, he said. He encouraged the IIM Indore community to respect not only Hindi but all the Indian languages. Mr. N.K. Singh threw light on the significance of Hindi as a language and its effect on various domains at the international level. We often create a set of norms that decides who our icons are and, thus, also generate a process to identify these icons. ‘Hindi Diwas reminds us that there’s a very palpable differentiation in the society’s economic, political, and social existence, and languages here play a vital role’, he said. Even though 75 percent of people speak Hindi in the nation, it hasn’t attained the respect and position that permits us to express our love for the language. We need to equalize the system that discriminates between rural and urban, rich and poor, educated and uneducated based on their language. ‘We can find a rich talent pool even in rural India, only if the youth there are allowed to take the lead. However, society today has a mindset that forces people to believe in the dominance of the English language, he said. Mentioning how the market forces hinder our thought process and don’t allow us to contemplate rationally, he emphasized the urgency of establishing a just and fair system that helps us identify our icons in an entirely new way – through their actions – and not by the words they speak. It’s time we encourage dynamic thinking, open our minds to all the Indian languages, and accept virtuous people, for knowledge and competency don’t depend upon the language a person speaks, but his reflexes and ability, he said. The 2022 edition of IIM Indore’s Annual Hindi Magazine – Gyaan Shikhar, was also released on this occasion. The contributors who presented the best articles were also felicitated by the Director and the Chief Guest. Previous Next"

Since many of the participants are living away from their parents for the first time in their lives, Shri Satwalekar advised them to embrace the change. “Even if you don’t like change, you can begin to build capabilities to adapt to change. Be flexible in your thinking approach and solution, and pivot the direction you are going. Let life unfold and grab every opportunity you get”, he said. He advised the participants to discover themselves, acquire knowledge to become a leader capable of creating more leaders, and build friendships. “You might be told that you should build ‘contacts’ while you pursue an MBA; however, I suggest you build deep, strong ‘relationships’ that last forever,” he said. Prof. Shruti Tewari mentioned that with ten years of IPM, the programme has over 1000 alumni who have demonstrated an incredible journey. “This batch is an inclusive one, with students from commerce, bio, maths, art, and humanities and has around 33 percent female participants”, Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash advised the participants to invest in the peer group learning process and gain the maximum from the peers and interactive learning sessions.

The institute aims to contribute to nation-building and ensures initiatives encouraging the IIMI family members to stay connected to their roots, culture, and the country. In line with this, the institute started two workshops for learning Sanskrit and Tamil languages, for everyone on campus. Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, inaugurated both workshops on August 31, 2022. Mr. Pravesh Vaishnav, Sanskrit Language Instructor; Ms. Lakshmi Gopalakrishnan, Tamil Language Instructor; and Col. Gururaj Gopinath Pamidi (Veteran), CAO, IIM Indore were also present. Prof. Rai captivated the participants with his inaugural address in English, Hindi, Sanskrit, and Tamil. He spoke about the significance of regional languages. ‘India has over 19,000 languages, and the dialect and pronunciation change in every region. We, the Indians, are a part of a nation that entirely reflects unity in diversity and is soaked in diverse cultures. This is what makes us and our nation unique’, he said. Having a basic knowledge of the colloquial languages in different regions can open our paths to numerous prospects, connect with people from varied backgrounds and allow us to stay allied to our roots, our nation, and our people in the country, as one. He also spoke about the emergence of Sanskrit and Tamil languages in India. He said that Tamil literature, especially the ‘Sangam Sahitya’, is rich in language and culture, for it imbibes numerous lessons on morality and ethics in itself. Tamil has spread its wings internationally and is spoken in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Java, Sumatra, and other south Asian nations, he said. Similarly, Sanskrit is not just limited to epics, but there are people, even though less in number, who still converse in Sanskrit. ‘Sanskrit is not spoken that widely, and thus, it is imperative that we start speaking it more often to preserve our rich culture’, he said. Stating that the New Education Policy emphasizes offering education in regional languages to the children, he said that IIM Indore also aims to generate a platform for the community members to learn, understand and gain knowledge so that they can converse, read and write Tamil and Sanskrit languages comfortably. Mr. Pravesh Vaishnav noted that Sanskrit is not a tough language to learn; all one needs is to listen and speak. ‘Just the way a child learns to speak a language while listening to its parents, Sanskrit can also be learned just by conversing’, he said. Whenever one talks about Sanskrit, they believe it is only about the shlokas and mantras. However, he said, Sanskrit is a universal language and exists all around us. ‘Learning by fun makes gaining knowledge easier. We can also play games in Sanskrit, and that’s how we can easily learn it. It is not an ancient language, but is considered a modern language as well, for we can even sing songs in it’, he explained. He advised the participants to keep conversing in the language to gain fluency, for that’s an essential way to learn a language. Col. Gururaj Pamidi delivered the vote of thanks. He noted that the institute would continue to generate opportunities for community members to learn more languages. The event concluded with great enthusiasm among the IIMI community members, eager to learn two new regional languages. Previous Next"

On average, about 1,50,000 people perish due to road accidents in India annually. Government data suggests that apart from lane indiscipline, jumping red lights, drunk driving, and using a mobile phone, over 70 percent of road accidents occur due to over-speeding, which accounts for 6 percent of the deaths from road accidents. IIM Indore is determined to remain contextually relevant and contribute to the welfare of society and nation-building. The institute has now taken a step to conduct research and share knowledge in road safety and security and has joined forces with the Police Training and Research Institute, Bhopal (PTRI). The MoU was signed by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, and Mr. G. Janardhan, IPS, Additional Director of Police, PTRI, Police Headquarters, Bhopal , on August 29, 2022. Mr. Manoj Rai, AIG, PTRI Bhopal; Mr. Rakesh Gupta, IPS, AIG – Rural, Indore; and Mr. Harinarayan Chari Mishra, IPS, Police Commissioner, Indore, were also present. The MoU aims to establish a framework for collaboration and cooperation for research and knowledge sharing in the field of road safety and providing solutions to road safety and social security issues. Sharing intense figures about the deaths of on-duty police officers from his previous research with the Uttar Pradesh government, Prof. Himanshu Rai said that 35,000 police officers had lost their lives since independence. ‘While working on the report, I was also stunned to learn that the perception of police officers is usually negative, despite their dedicated, devoted, and prolonged working hours. It is natural for police officers to feel hassled and anxious, for they are working non-stop to ensure our safety. Then, I decided that we need to do something for our brilliant police officers, he said. This MoU with PTRI Bhopal is yet another initiative by IIM Indore to facilitate the police officers in their jobs by identifying the issues related to road safety and offering them training and solutions to lessen the number of accidents in the state. Fifty-five percent of road accidents are on the highways, and one-third of the wounded are on two-wheeler. Road accidents impact the GDP, as our logistics sluggish down and are wedged by 14 percent when the traffic is slow. Nobody wants to invest in a city, state, or country that isn’t safe. We need to reinforce law and order, implement strategies that make our cities safe and secure, especially for women, and help reduce the number of accidents annually by 10 percent. With our expertise in management, strategy, and planning, he said, we look forward to conducting training and educational sessions for the administrators and policy-makers in the road safety and security field. He added that the MoU comprises creating reports, making plans, conducting conferences, collaborating for joint research, etc., which boost cooperation and collaboration in fields of mutual interest. ‘I am sure this association would prove fruitful in developing solutions to the road and social security issues by planning and engineering and provide a platform for faculty exchange’, said Prof. Rai. Mr. G. Janardhan expressed his delight over collaborating with IIM Indore. He said that PTRI is happy to join hands with IIM Indore, one of the premier management institutes in India. ‘I am sure the robustly designed teaching module by the brilliant IIM Indore faculty would pave the path for generating effective solutions for road safety. Every year 12,000 people lose their lives in road accidents in the state. With the increase in cases related to road safety and other social issues, training modules by the faculty from IIM Indore would further augment our managerial and leadership skills’. He said that research in emerging areas of road safety would also be helpful, for the report would then be submitted to various funding agencies. PTRI and IIM Indore will work together on issues related specifically to Madhya Pradesh, thereby contributing to the administrative growth of the state, identifying the accident-prone areas, generating awareness among the citizens about the road safety measures, boosting the infrastructure, and preparing guidelines for traffic rules according to the region. Mr. Manoj Rai stated that there had been a 21 percent upsurge in the number of road accidents, an 11 percent rise in fatalities, and a 25 percent increase in the figure of the victims. ‘Madhya Pradesh Safety Plan focuses on 4Es – Education, Enforcement, Engineering, and Emergency Care. However, this hasn’t been executed effectively. This MoU with IIM Indore will aid us in identifying the root cause of such issues and implement the guidelines in a better way’, he said. Mr. Rakesh Gupta said that the number of road accidents is substantial in rural areas, for every road from a village is connected to a highway. ‘Traffic management in urban areas might be comparatively more manageable, but it’s time we identify the methods that eliminate devastating highway accidents. He said that the development of roads, driving speed, clear vision for the driver, and eligibility of a driver need to be reconsidered. Mr. Harinarayan Chari Mishra added that the figure for accident fatalities in India is higher than in foreign nations, for the quality of roads and awareness among the citizens in a foreign land is way better than in India. ‘With the emergence of technology, we live in a world of driverless cars. He said that we need to predict and analyze future challenges that may arise to ensure our citizens’ safety. The MoU will be valid for five years. IIM Indore has signed an MoU with the Madhya Pradesh Police to further reinforce the two’s professionalism and contribute to developing a superior security environment and orderliness in public places through a mutual academic-practitioner collaboration system. The institute also has associations with Panchayat & Rural Development Department (R&RDD), MP Urban Development and Housing, and MP Industrial Development Corporation. IIM Indore is also researching beat policing and regularly organizes financial literacy workshops for the wives of police officers. Over 100 police officers also witnessed the MoU signing ceremony at IIM Indore. The event concluded with a vote of thanks by Col. Gururaj Gopinath Pamidi (Veteran), CAO, IIM Indore Previous Next"

In his Independence Day address, Prof. Rai spoke of acquiring ‘real freedom by overcoming fear, negativity, and envy.’ Explaining further, he shared his views about the three types of fears we face, namely, fear of losing money, fear of change, and fear of failure. ‘We often think about money in terms of self-worth. If you can separate desires from necessities and manage your desires, you will attain freedom from the fear of losing money’, he said. Explaining how we, as humans, often resist change, Prof. Rai threw light on the significance of the status quo in our lives. Change is inevitable, and we need to accept the change – no matter what, for that enables us to be free from the fear of change. ‘We are all scared of change because we have doubts about failure. ‘What if I fail, what if I lose? These thoughts often stop us from accepting change and make us afraid of failure. Remember, we don’t fail if we lose. We fail when we stop trying. He said that one needs to work hard and have the perseverance and grit to achieve their goals. Prof. Rai also advised the gathering to eliminate negativity from their lives. ‘Many times, we are surrounded by people who discourage us and tell us what we are doing is wrong and why it won’t work.

The panel was moderated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Prof. Rai introduced the topic and asked the panelists their views about a diverse range of various facets of media and journalism, including TRP, maintaining a balance between truth and the right, and how the media is thriving, being independent, and experimenting today. Sharing his views on whether journalism has deteriorated, Mr. Satish Jacob noted that the media is facing many problems and challenges; however, this is just a temporary phase. “I believe that Indian media would return to its original form and start playing the role it is supposed to play in people’s lives – the responsibility of passing the information without any bias”, he said. Media is a part of the progress and pride of the nation, and thus, its role is a sacred one. Media is part and parcel of the regime of the country. He added that if a journalist doesn’t get freedom, the nation may not progress. Mr. Satish K Singh shared insights on the difference between managing and manipulating media. “Media is a vast term, and journalists are a part of the media. He said, ” suppressing the truth or exaggerating facts isn’t authentic journalism,” he said. Information, disinformation, misinformation, and over information are different. Also, Propaganda, publicity and journalism are different and a journalist needs to understand the difference between these, he added. Mr. Ajay Kumar threw light on the fact that every person has a perspective, and the element of subjectivity is significant for media houses. “Every person with a phone today is a journalist. They look at the happenings around and have their own point of view that they want to have their own identity and personality. We live in an evolving society and media needs to be reflective”, he said. Mr. Saurabh Dwivedi, sharing an entirely different perspective on modern journalism, noted that every age is a golden age for media. “Every industry encounters challenges, and so does media. We as humans revolved other times, encountered problems, found solutions, and thrived and survived. It all depends on how media utilizes the sources”, he said. One needs to grab the opportunities to improve and experiment while in media and this would help maintain a balance in success and feeling content, he added. The panel concluded with a Q&A.

The three-day conference is being conducted in a hybrid mode. Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, inaugurated the conference. Prof. Abhishek Mishra, Chair – FPM, IIM Indore; and Prof. Vivek Suneja, Dean – FMS Delhi, were also present on occasion. In his inaugural address, Prof. Rai shared his views about how leadership needs to change amidst digital transformation, especially concerning education and research. Mentioning that initially, business schools focused on enhancing their students’ business acumen and management skills, he said that now is the right time for the educational institutions to adapt to the digital change and focus on the fundamental roots of management and leadership. ‘We as academicians now need to focus on creating, advancing, and disseminating knowledge. It’s time that we as educational institutions start practicing what we preach and implement that in every domain – education, research, government, administration, etc.’, he said. The digital decade has led us into a world where participants now choose how, when and what they wish to study. This has to be bolstered with curating knowledge by augmenting the curiosity to find answers through a digital platform and by understanding the Be-Know-Do Framework. Explaining further, he suggested the conference participants ‘Be’ compassionate towards everyone. ‘Our job is not to merely comply with the industry requirements but also to educate the industry. As scholars and educators, we also need to challenge the industry for their decisions, rather than just conducting research and finding solutions for their problems’, he said. He suggested that one needs to ‘Know’ their true identity, find out what they are passionate about, and not rely on their designation. ‘As a human, we are often tempted to take shortcuts. But ensure that you always do the right thing. If ever you feel fear or shame while making a decision, or have a doubt in your mind – don’t do it’, he concluded. Prof. Suneja shared some brilliant insights on how artificial intelligence has impacted our lives, but it remains ‘artificial’ only. ‘According to me, intelligence and creativity go hand in hand. The ability to spot patterns in a system is intelligence. He said that the ability to remember that is memory and to repeat is artificial intelligence. Humans have the inbuilt power of discovering and inventing. A machine can never be as intelligent as a human. Even though machines may replace us in most of our jobs, the majority of which also make our lives easier, they can never be as intelligent as us. ‘Intelligence is spiritual, and only we humans can feel that. Technology, invented by humans, is supposed to add comfort to our lives. Social media was meant to liberate us, but it has led to a need for validation from everyone around and FOMO. It’s time we start to be creative, discover, and invent. Let us be the ones governing the digital decade and utilize it not only for our betterment but also for creating a sustainable and equitable living. The day witnessed three insightful sessions on a wide range of topics. Prof. Bipul Kumar, Faculty, IIM Indore, gave some insights on Bibliometric Analysis. The second workshop was conducted by Prof. Arvind Sahay, Marketing Area, IIM Ahmedabad, on the topic – Applications of Neuroscience to Online Branding.

The highlight of the first day was an insightful and interactive panel discussion on the topic ‘Challenges faced by educators during COVID19’. The panelists included academicians from all four directions of the nation. Prof. Subin Sudhir, Chair – Executive Education and Faculty, IIM Indore represented the central and the western region; Prof. Richa Saxena, Faculty, IMT Ghaziabad, shared her views from northern India; Prof. Manish Kumar from IIM Ranchi brought some insights from eastern India and Prof. Amol Subhash Dhaigude, Faculty, TA Pai Management Institute shared his experience representing southern India. Sharing how IIM Indore efficiently managed its transition from offline to online classes during the pandemic, Prof. Subin Sudhir mentioned the significance of online classroom activities and upgrading the instructor’s skills. ‘Pandemic helped us understand the intensity of the digital divide while conducting online classes. However, it also allowed us to enhance our abilities and augment our teaching pedagogies, especially while considering the requirements of the students who live in remote areas, he said. We realized that technology plays a significant role in imparting education in delivery and retaining knowledge. ‘The students started reading and gaining information from the internet, not just the course material or the textbooks. He explained that this has encouraged the faculty members to be prepared, updated, and anticipate the questions during online classes. We revised our curriculum according to the needs of the students and ensured to keep the content interesting, engaging, and informative by incorporating videos and online interaction activities, he said. Prof. Richa Saxena noted that the transition from offline to online was difficult, especially in delivery, engagement, and retention. ‘Internet connectivity, power cuts, lack of ability to see the students’ reactions, etc., were some of the challenges we faced during the lockdown. ‘Offline classrooms help a teacher interact with a student smoothly and more beneficially, for its two-way communication. On the other hand, online classes restrict you to one-way communication. She explained that you need to ensure that whatever is being taught in an online class is being grasped well by the students. However, online classes came with a silver lining of allowing us to invite speakers from across the globe who could share their experiences with our students and enhance their knowledge in various fields. This helped us enrich the curriculum and the content and expand the students’ horizons in various subjects’, she said. Prof. Manish Kumar shared his experiences while teaching online and emphasized being open-minded during the transition. ‘Not having adequate staff on the campus, internet connectivity issues, and other technical issues were challenging. However, with time, we learned to use the software, adapt to the online classes and find solutions to the problems we as faculty and students were facing’, he said. We also decided to change our classroom rules and be liberal to encourage more interaction during online sessions. Unlike offline classes where chatting with each other wasn’t allowed, we now permitted the students to break into online rooms and have discussions and doubt clearing sessions. ‘We have also been able to conduct online placements and have recruited faculty members whom we didn’t meet for two years. However, these two years have made us adept at online teaching and augmented our teaching skills. This has been a memorable learning experience’, he said. Prof. Amol Dhaigune mentioned that online education has increased students’ screen time and has taken a toll on everyone’s health, including faculty and administration. The students also experience isolation as they can’t interact with their batchmates. ‘I believe that the role of an institute is to support and promote online education, give adequate support and training to the faculty and staff and enhance their infrastructure,’ he said. Pandemic gave academicians a chance to overcome the fear of online teaching and find innovative ways to engage the students. ‘I ensure to incorporate an element of surprise in my lectures, and this could be a meme or a trending video that students are talking about. He said this had facilitated me in staying updated and keeping the students interested in the classes. Pandemic has also encouraged us to learn new skills. ‘Being a candidate at the FDP at IIM Indore during the pandemic has helped me learn new methods and teaching skills that proved extremely beneficial for me,’ he concluded.

This conference offers a diverse forum for academicians, practitioners, industrialists, and students to discuss the issues, challenges, and advancements in managing the global pandemic. The conference was inaugurated online by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore, and Mr. Amit Paliwal, Program Director, GIZ India, on April 16, 2022. Prof. Mit Vachhrajani, Conference Convenor and Faculty, IIM Indore and Prof. Pritam Ranjan, Dean – Research, IIM Indore; Prof. Abhishek Mishra, Faculty, IIM Indore; Prof. Subin Sudhir, Chair – Executive Education, IIM Indore; and Prof. Sushant Mishra; Faculty, IIM Bangalore were also present. In his welcome address, Prof. Himanshu Rai shared his thoughts on how the COVID pandemic has provided us an opportunity to build our vision, introspect, and discover. He noted that similar to every organization with an established vision, we, humans, should also have a vision for ourselves. ‘Having a vision helps us identify our purpose of existence. As teachers and research scholars, we need to find our purpose and then work hard towards achieving it. Thus, while you attend this conference, utilize this opportunity to build your network and decide where you are headed’, he explained. He mentioned that being a teacher makes a person a leader. ‘Whether you like it or not, your students will definitely follow your actions. Set an example for them by choosing the right thing and making the right decisions at the right time. Take a pause in this busy life, introspect, and then choose your action’, he said. He advised the participants not to measure their self-worth based on the designation. ‘Your identity is who you are and what you are passionate about. Do not dwell on your superficial identity of holding a designation or a position – for once you lose it, your identity would be lost’, he concluded. Mr. Amit Paliwal shared his delight over collaborating with IIM Indore. He noted that the past two years had been the most challenging times for the world, especially in India. Millions of people have lost their lives, and the economic sectors have faced disruptions like never before. The industries that usually were not affected by the environment, like education and healthcare, also saw a massive shift in their working methods. ‘This fruitful association with IIM Indore has provided us with an opportunity to provide a platform for the academicians, industrialists, and researchers to come together and share their ideas to figure out how India can emerge even stronger in the post-pandemic era’, he said. Industry Guest Speaker, Mr. Madhav Kalyan, MD & CEO, JP Morgan Chase Bank India, threw light upon the impact of COVID on the banking sector. He said that the pandemic has resulted in a disruption in demand, supply, and financial shock, thereby resulting in an economic downturn. ‘The five major long-term implications that we could manifest in the post-pandemic India are low-interest-rate environment, accelerated digitalization of financial services, slowing down of a customer-bank relationship and communication, coupling of digitalization of transactions with the traditional banking system, weakness in banks’ balance sheets and regulation. ‘Inflation has been a persistent problem for the last few decades. However, with the pandemic, we also witnessed problems in the demand-supply chain in the economic sector. The strict social distancing norms have also encouraged the banks to restructure their policies and network while strengthening their customer relationships and retainment. The digital and cashless payment system initially became a threat to the intermediate role banks played; however, with the new policies by the government and the RBI, the banks are once again recovering’, he explained. He noted that the lower economic activity and supply-chain bottleneck are the challenges that need to be resolved. ‘The pandemic has proved that even though the second wave was extreme and the huge impact, our economic system was resilient and strong enough to rebound and is on the way to recovery. It is time that we now take this post-pandemic scenario as an opportunity to strengthen it further, he concluded. The day concluded with paper presentations on various tracks that would continue tomorrow. A panel discussion on the topic ‘Challenges faced by educators during the pandemic’ will also take place. The three best paper awards will also be announced tomorrow during the valedictory session. Previous Next"

Chief Guest Mr. Siddharth Sethi, Co-Founder – InfoBeans; Prof. Saurabh Chandra, Chair – EPGP; and Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash, Dean – Programmes, and other faculty members were present on occasion. Prof. Himanshu Rai, in his address, shared three lessons he learned from his corporate and academic journey. Sharing the first lesson of finding one’s purpose and blending it with vision and imagination, Prof. Rai encouraged the participants to endure to work hard. ‘If you continue to work hard, you will become ‘someone’ and reach ‘somewhere’ – but is that what you want? It is imperative to know your vision – what you wish to be – and then work towards attaining it,’ he said. He advised the participants to envision the world they wish to live in and then work to create the same. ‘Once you understand your purpose, you can identify your relationship with everything – the world, the people around, the society, nature, etc. This helps you to comprehend your obligations and responsibilities and boosts you to work in the right direction’, he said. Second, he guided the participants to pursue excellence. He noted that one could achieve excellence only when they are chasing perfection. ‘Figure out your true potential, enhance your ability, and have the willingness, for these will help you succeed,’ he said. Having a ‘grit’ is as significant as working hard, he explained in the third lesson. ‘Hard work isn’t enough. Perseverance is the key. Even if you stumble and fail a couple of times, have the resilience to get up and start walking again’, he concluded. Mr. Siddharth Sethi shared his life journey with the new batch. He mentioned that he derives his ambitious behavior from his mother – who has always encouraged him to accomplish goals and move ahead in life. ‘My mom always inspired me and considered my career her own, which has helped me become who I am today. I enrolled into this brilliantly designed curriculum by IIM Indore as advised by my mother, and it has proven to be the best programme,’ he said. He noted that the programme ensures the overall development of managerial skills in the classrooms and interactions with peers from diverse backgrounds with rich working experience. He advised the participants to dream big and keep learning. ‘I believe that one needs to keep learning, unlearning, and upgrading their knowledge. This helps you network with like-minded people and involve more people in your dream. A dream seen alone is just a dream, but a dream seen together is a reality,’ he said. He noted that after graduation, this programme won’t only develop the participants into better managers but will also help them realize their potential and encourage them to contribute to their careers, society, and nation-building. Prof. Saurabh Chandra briefed the participants about the curriculum. The new batch also received briefings on the institute’s facilities and library resources. The inauguration concluded with a vote of thanks by Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash. A total of 59 participants (9 females and 50 males) with an average work experience of 8.95 years have registered for the programme. Previous Next"

Prof. Himanshu Rai, in his speech, shared his life experiences and the lessons that helped him succeed during his journey as a teacher. Sharing his personal experience of switching from corporate to academia, Prof. Rai suggested the new batch follow their passion. ‘When I switched from Tata Steel and decided to become a teacher, I witnessed resistance from the people around. However, I believe that one should always chase one’s dream and work hard to achieve what brings them joy and a sense of contentment’, he said. Explaining the significance of doing the right thing, he mentioned that being a teacher is all about integrity. As a person, one must ensure that we do what we say and we say what we mean. ‘Whatever you think, speak or do has to be in consonance. The true strength of a character gets reflected when nobody is watching. If ever you feel embarrassed or fearsome or doubt your action, don’t pursue it. Listen to your heart and make sure you take the right decision’, he suggested. He advised the batch comprising faculty members and research scholars to overcome the resistance they might face while doing something new. ‘Perseverance is the key. Do not give up on your dreams because you are skeptical about what others would think or say about you. Listen to your heart and keep learning and moving ahead’, he concluded. Prof. Saumya Ranjan Dash and Prof. Subin Sudhir welcomed the new batch and advised them to learn within the classroom sessions and from the informal conversations with their peers. ‘Make optimum use of this opportunity and augment your knowledge by sharing,’ they said.

Find what gives you happiness and joy – and continue working passionately for that’, he said. He noted that during one’s professional journey, one must ensure to take into consideration the views of others. ‘You may feel that you are an asset, but you might have now become a liability for others.

It’s time we embrace the change during disruptions’, he said. Mentioning that this is the best time to enter the industry, Mr. Bakshi encouraged the participants to stay keen on being innovative, curious and updating their knowledge. ‘Being a student, you work hard and achieve high scores. However, as a professional, you may work hard and face challenges. Your industry might go weak, or you may get a demanding boss.

The batch was inaugurated by Prof. Himanshu Rai, Director, IIM Indore. Mr. Gagandeep Singh, Country President and Managing Director, AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited was the Chief Guest for the occasion. Prof. Shruti Tewari, IPM Programme Chair; Prof. Sushanta Kumar Mishra, Dean-Programmes and Col. Gururaj Gopinath Pamidi (Retd), CAO, IIM Indore were also present during the inauguration. Prof. Himanshu Rai welcomed the new batch and shared an entirely new perspective for IPM: Integrity, Purpose and Meaningfulness. He noted that it’s important to understand that you can only be happy, content and successful if you say what you mean and do what you say. ‘Thoughts may be difficult to control as our mind travels as far in wakefulness as it does while we sleep. Controlling the thoughts might be difficult, but we need to ensure that our words, thoughts and actions are in harmony. This is where integrity comes in – the integrity to give your cent percent to every job you do and perform to your true potential, with a positive thought’, he said. He advised the new Batch to find their Purpose- the ‘P’ in IPM. Figure out the universe you want to live in, an equitable world with opportunities without any discrimination, full of justice, free of violence and oppression; and remember that you need to create that world for yourself. Sharing the significance of ‘Meaningfulness’, he encouraged the participants to be passionate about everything they do and be compassionate towards themselves and others. ‘Invest in yourself. Don’t carry anger for anyone or guilt about anything; for when you do, you are being violent towards yourself’, he suggested. Sharing insights from his journey, Mr. Gagandeep Singh explained to the new batch the importance of investing in relationships and life skills. ‘I realized during my journey that academic rigor isn’t enough, one also needs life skills to survive and be successful. You are going to learn as you grow and work together, and be able to find solutions to the problems of the community, and that’s what will make you content and satisfied, he said. India is all about solution-finders and creators; and the nation needs young minds who can analyse the problems and offer innovative and long-lasting solutions. Mr. Singh further elaborated and mentioned that there might be failures and disappointments while moving towards a goal, but one shouldn’t let fears affect the determination. ‘Keep moving forward and don’t let yourself get enclosed in negativity and fears. Try to focus on improving yourself just by one percent, regularly, again and again. That one percent brings significant results at the end and that’s when you will realise that you have had a great time full of learnings and experiences’, he said. Emphasising how global leadership helped us fight the pandemic, Mr. Singh said that together, we need to analyse the problems and find solutions, thereafter developing strategies to implement the solutions rapidly. ‘We realised that the production of the vaccine was based on the foundation that none of us would be safe till all of us are safe. Resilience played a very important role during this pandemic, and I feel fortunate to be a part of this journey’, he said. Addressing the new batch, he said that the values you learn at IIM Indore and the skills you develop will become your guiding light in the future. ‘IQ and discourse don’t matter as much as skills and resilience. Being a team player and collaborating is important and that will help you find success in life and profession. ‘Keep learning, keep upgrading yourself and always be curious. Being a learner helps you adapt to the changes and bring changes as well, for the betterment of the society’, he concluded. IIM Indore’s IPM has completed ten years this year, with the commencement of the new batch. On this occasion, the ‘Ten Years of IPM’ video was also launched by Prof. Himanshu Rai, which gave insights into the decade-long journey of the unique flagship programme, launched in 2011.

However, people tend to get frightened to chase their dreams as they age; and to realise our own destiny should only be our obligation. He said that the fear of gaining or losing money and the fear of failure keeps us from giving our best to accomplish our dreams. ‘Money is what money does- nothing more and nothing less. Also, you don’t become a failure when you go wrong. You become a failure when you stop trying new things because you are scared to fail’, he explained.  He noted that this MDP would help the participants understand the nuances of negotiation and conflict; and will help them become a better negotiator—considering the fact that these frontline warriors have to face multiple challenging conflicts on day to day basis.

Congratulating the graduating batches, Professor Rai said that with this programme, the batch is not just gaining knowledge about IPBA, but also entering into a new world – a world of Integrity, Purpose, Boldness and Accountability. ‘To me, corruption is perversion of integrity. If you are not doing the best of what you are supposed to do with the best of your ability—you are corrupt. Integrity isn’t merely about saying or doing what you say. It is about the fact that whatever you say, whatever you do and whatever you think need to be in consonant—to create a world which is just and prosperous’, he said. He noted that one needs to find the purpose of their life, be passionate about it and get a sense of fulfilment. ‘Achievement without fulfilment is meaningless. Purpose gives you your identity and helps you find your objective of the life’, he explained. He said that one should be bold against the fear of losing money and the greed of money; the self-defeating belief of why you are not good enough; and the fear of trying something new—since one doesn’t become a failure if he or she fails, but becomes a failure when he or she stops trying.
